The column labelled `Lags' indicates how many lags of the change in the inflation rate are included in the regression.  With zero lags, the test is the original Dickey-Fuller test; with multiple lags, the test is an Augmented Dickey Fuller test.  In both cases a constant term is permitted in the regression equation.  The sample is from 1959q3 to 2001q2 (quarterly data from my DRI database begin in 1959q1.  In order to have the same sample for all three tests, the sample must be restricted to 1959q3 and after.)  One, two, and three stars indicate rejections of a unit root at the 10 percent, 5 percent, and one percent thresholds.  RATS code generating these and all other empirical results is available at the author's website.}\caption{Dickey-Fuller and Augmented Dickey-Fuller Tests for a Unit Root in Inflation}\label{table:ADFpi}\end{table}%\end{document}
