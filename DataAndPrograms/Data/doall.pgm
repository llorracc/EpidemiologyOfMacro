It is not possible to have a single control program generate all theresults in the paper, because the process of clearing memory in RATS alsostops any program in its tracks.  The names of each of the input files fortables or figures in the LaTeX document corresponds to the name of the RATSprogram that generates that table or figure, so regenerating any resultssimply requires firing up RATS and executing the appropriate program.
