Yet there has been almost norecent effort to model actual empirical expectations data; instead,macroeconomists usually simply assume expectations are `rational.' This paper shows that while empirical household expectations are notrational in the usual sense, expectational dynamics are wellcaptured by a model in which households' views derive from newsreports of the views of professional forecasters, which in turn may berational.  The model's estimates imply that people only occasionallypay attention to news reports; this inattention generates `stickyness'in aggregate expectations, with important macroeconomic consequences.\medskip \medskip {\bf Keywords}: inflation, expectations, unemployment,monetary policy, agent-based modeling\medskip\medskip{\bf JEL Classification Codes: D84, E31} \medskip\medskip\small This paper is derived from a paper originally entitled ``TheEpidemiology of Macroeconomic Expectations'' written in connectionwith the conference ``The Economy As an Evolving Complex System III''at the Santa Fe Institute in November of 2001, honoring KennethArrow's contributions to the Santa Fe Institute and to economics.

Keynes himselfbelieved that economies could experience fluctuations that reflectedmovements in `animal spirits,' but the basis for most of today's macromodels was laid in the rational expectations revolution of the 1970s. Early critics of the rational expectations approach complained that,in the words of Friedman~\cite{friedman:extreme}, such models lacked``a clear outline of the way in which economic agents derive theknowledge which they then use to formulate expectations,'' but inrecent years the criticisms have focused on the difficulty rationalexpectations models have in reproducing various features ofmacroeconomic data like the high persistence of inflation (Fuhrer andMoore~\cite{fuhrer&moore:persistence}) and the apparent inexorabilityof the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment(Ball~\cite{ball:sacrifice}; Mankiw~\cite{mankiw:inexorable}).  Theliterature has consequently begun to explore the implications formacroeconomic dynamics of various alternative assumptions aboutexpectations formation, most notably models of learning, seeSargent~\cite{sargent:bounded} or Evans andHonkapohja~\cite{evans&honk:book} for surveys.Remarkably, however, there has been almost no work testing alternativemodels of expectations using actual empirical data on expectations. McCallum's~\cite{mccallum:review} recent survey, for example, does notdiscuss results from a single paper that examines empiricalexpectations data.  This is not for lack of data: The University ofMichigan's Survey Research Center has been collecting information onhouseholds' expectations about inflation, unemployment, economicgrowth, interest rates, and other macroeconomic matters for almost 50years, the Conference Board has conducted similar monthly surveys ofhouseholds since the late 1970s, and the Survey of ProfessionalForecasters and its antecedents have collected data since the 1960s. While there has been some work testing (and usually rejecting) therationality of these expectations,\footnote{SeeCroushore~\cite{croushore:spfisgood}, Thomas~\cite{thomas:surveyinfl}, and Mehra~\cite{mehra:surveyinfl} for surveys.} aside from aninsightful paper by Roberts~\cite{roberts:inflexp} and an impressive(and very recent) paper by Branch~\cite{branch:hetero} there appearsto have been essentially no work proposing and testing positivealternative models for how empirical expectations areformed.\footnote{The only other even tangentially relevant papers Ihave found were by Fishe and Idson~\cite{fishe&idson:infohetero} whotest a model of heterogeneous demand for information using two years'worth of Michigan Survey data; a paper by Urich andWachtel~\cite{urich&wachtel:money} that tests rationality using surveydata on money supply forecasts; and a paper by Dua andRay~\cite{dua&ray:arima} that models SPF data using an ARIMAforecasting framework.}% This paper proposes a positive modelThis paper proposes and tests one such model.  Rather than having fullunderstanding of the `true' macroeconomic model and constantlytracking the latest statistics to produce their own macroeconomicforecasts, typical people are assumed to obtain their macroeconomicviews from the news media.  Furthermore (and importantly), not everyperson pays close attention to all macroeconomic news; instead,individual people are assumed to absorb the economic content of newsstories probabilistically, so that it may take quite some time fornews of changed macroeconomic circumstances to penetrate to all agentsin the economy.  Finally, the news media in turn are assumed to reportthe views of professional forecasters, who may themselves makerational forecasts.  (The structure of the model was inspired bysimple models of disease from the epidemiology literature; see thecompanion paper Carroll~\cite{carroll:epidemicinflSFI}) for more onthe epidemiological foundations of the model and for a demonstrationthat more elaborate ``epidemiological expectations'' models generateresults similar to those of the baseline model presented here.)% Provides simple equation similar to Mankiw and Reis; microfoundationsThe baseline model provides a simple equation for the evolution ofmean expectations that is very similar to an equation proposed inrecent papers by Mankiw andReis~\cite{mankiw&reis:slumps,mankiw&reis:stickye}.  Indeed, the modelpresented here could be viewed as providing microfoundations for theMankiw and Reis equation.  Another contribution is the derivation of aparticularly simple specialization of that equation suitable forempirical work; this specialization turns out to yield an equationlike one estimated by Roberts~\cite{roberts:inflexp}, for which it canagain be regarded as providing a microfoundation.  Finally, themodel's explicit assumption that people derive their expectations fromnews reports (and the paper's specific proposal for how to measurenews coverage) respond to Friedman's~\cite{friedman:extreme}criticism of the unspecified nature of the expectations formationmechanism in rational expectations models.% Application to inflation expectations: once a yearThe model is applied to estimate the evolution of inflationexpectations and unemployment expectations from the Michigan Survey ofConsumers.  For inflation, the typical household is estimated toupdate expectations roughly once a year, while unemploymentexpectations appear to be updated slightly more frequently. Furthermore, in a horserace between a version of the model wherepeople update their expectations either to the rationalforward-looking forecast or to the most recently reported paststatistics (the `adaptive expectations' model), the data stronglyprefer the forward-looking version of the model.  Thus, the resultscan be interpreted as reflecting a plausible middle ground betweenfully rational expectations and adaptive expectations.% Implications for macro dynamics not addressed here; see M&R and RobertsA final section briefly comments on the relationship between thismodel and some of the relevant existing empirical literature, withparticular emphasis on the relationship of the model to sticky-pricemodels and the model's implications for the relationship betweencredibility and monetary policy.  The implications of the model formacroeconomic dynamics are not addressed here, because the papers byMankiw and Reis~\cite{mankiw&reis:slumps,mankiw&reis:stickye} andRoberts~\cite{roberts:phillips,roberts:stickyinfl} address thosequestions and are directly applicable.  Mankiw and Reis show thattheir model can explain many phenomena that are unexplained by fullyrational models, including why disinflations are inevitablycontractionary; why monetary policy affects the economy withconsiderable lags; why rapid economic growth leads to risinginflation; and why productivity slowdowns are associated with a risein the natural rate of unemployment.  The ability to solve all ofthese puzzles seems a large dividend in exchange for the small priceof relaxing the assumption that all agents' expectations are fullyrational (in the sense required by typical rational expectationsmodels) at every instant.% Relation to literature on credibility\section{The Model}% Suppose people form inflation expectations by reading newspapersConsider a world where most people form their expectations aboutfuture inflation by reading newspaper articles.  Imagine for themoment that every inflation article contains a complete forecast ofthe inflation rate for all future quarters, and suppose (againmomentarily) that any person who reads such an article cansubsequently recall the entire forecast.% Not everybody reads every article; probabilisticAssume that not everybody reads every newspaper article on inflation. Instead, in any given period each individual faces a constantprobability $\lambda$ of encountering and absorbing the contents of anarticle on inflation.  Individuals who do not encounter an articlesimply continue to believe the last forecast they read about.  Thus,the framework is mathematically similar to theCalvo~\cite{calvoPrices} model of sticky prices in which firms changetheir prices with probability $p$.% Leads to expectations being infinite distributed lagCall $\pi_{t+1}$ the inflation rate between quarter $t$ and quarter $t+1$,\begin{eqnarray*} 	\pi_{t+1} & = & \log(p_{t+1})-\log(p_{t}),\end{eqnarray*}where $p_{t}$ is the aggregate price index in period $t$.  If we define $M_{t}$ as the operator that yields the population-mean value of inflation expectations at time $t$ and denote the {\bf N}ewspaper forecast printed in quarter $t$ for inflation in quarter $s \geq t$ as $N_{t}[\pi_{s}]$, we have that\footnote{Here we are assuming that all newspapers report the same forecast for inflation; see Carroll~\cite{carroll:epidemicinflSFI} for a version that allows for the possibility that different newspapers print different forecasts; that paper shows that results in such a model are similar to those presented here.}\begin{eqnarray}	M_{t}[\pi_{t+1}] & = & \lambda N_{t}[\pi_{t+1}]	+(1-\lambda) \left\{ \lambda N_{t-1}[\pi_{t+1}]	+(1-\lambda)\left(\lambda N_{t-2}[\pi_{t+1}] 	+ \ldots \right) \right\}. \label{eq:stickyerat}\end{eqnarray}The derivation of this equation is as follows.  In period $t$ a fraction $\lambda$ of the population will have absorbed the current-period newspaper forecast for the next quarter, $N_{t}[\pi_{t+1}]$.  Fraction $(1-\lambda)$ of the population retains the views they held in period $t-1$ of period $t+1$'s inflation rate.  Those period-$t-1$ views in turn can be decomposed into a fraction $\lambda$ of people who encountered an article in period $t-1$ and obtained the newspaper forecast of period $t+1$'s forecast, $N_{t-1}[\pi_{t+1}]$, and a fraction $(1-\lambda)$ who retained their period-$t-2$ views about the inflation forecast in period $t+1$.  Recursion leads to the remainder of the equation.% Similar to M&R expressionThis expression for inflation expectations is identical to the oneproposed by Mankiw andReis~\cite{mankiw&reis:slumps,mankiw&reis:stickye}, except that intheir framework updating agents compute their own forecasts under theusual assumptions of rational expectations.  Mankiw and Reis motivatetheir assumption that forecasts are updated only occasionally byarguing that there may be costs to obtaining or processinginformation.  It is undoubtedly true that developing a reasonablyrational quarter-by-quarter forecast of inflation arbitrarily far intothe future would be a very costly enterprise for a typical person (forexample, it might require obtaining an economics Ph.D. first!).  ButMankiw and Reis do not provide any formal model of informationprocessing costs that leads to their specification, and indeed itseems likely that a formal model of processing costs might imply anupdating process quite different from the Poisson process Mankiw andReis assume.\footnote{See Sims~\cite{sims:inattention} for amodel grounded in information theory that provides a formal model ofdecisionmaking under information-processing constraints.}% epidemiological model is a microfoundationThe model proposed above can be regarded as a microfoundation for theMankiw and Reis equation~\eqref{eq:stickyerat}.  Its value as amicrofoundation is illustrated in the usual way: it providesadditional testable implications that do not follow directly from theaggregate specification.  In particular, the baseline model impliesthat in periods when there are more news stories on inflation, thespeed of updating should be faster, an implication that is borne outin the empirical work below.  It also provides implications for theanalysis of the underlying micro data from the Michigan survey.  Inparticular, Souleles~\cite{souleles:sentiment} finds highlystatistically significant differences across demographic groups inmacroeconomic forecasts; the model suggests examiningwhether those differences can be explained by information ondemographic differences in readership rates of newspapers, or moregeneral data on differences in the extent to which different groupspay attention to economic matters.% Need to relax assumption that newspapers print infinite forecastsOf course, real newspaper articles do not contain a quarter-by-quarterforecast of the inflation rate into the infinite future as assumed inthe derivation of \eqref{eq:stickyerat}, and even if they did it isvery unlikely that a typical person would be able to remember thedetailed pattern of inflation rates far into the future.  Furthermore,even if both of these assumptions were true,equation~\eqref{eq:stickyerat} wound not be testable in its currentform because the available survey data report only households'expectations about inflation rates over the next year.  In order toderive implications from the model that are testable with these data,it turns out to be necessary to impose some structure on households'implicit views about the inflation process.% Suppose people believe in a fundamental inflation rateSuppose people believe that at any given time the economy has an underlying ``fundamental'' inflation rate.  Furthermore, suppose they believe that future changes in the fundamental rate are unforecastable; that is, beyond the next period the fundamental rate follows a random walk.  Finally, assume that people believe that the actual inflation rate in a given quarter is equal to that period's fundamental rate plus an error term $\epsilon_{t}$ which reflects unforecastable transitory inflation shocks (reflected in the `special factors' that newspaper inflation stories often emphasize).  Thus, the typical person believes that the inflation process is captured by\begin{eqnarray}	\pi_{t} & = & \pi_{t}^{f}+\epsilon_{t}            \label{eq:Fpi} \\   \pi_{t+1}^{f} & = & \pi_{t}^{f}+\eta_{t+1}  \label{eq:Fpi2},%\\   \pi_{t+2}^{f} & = & \pi_{t+1}^{f}+\eta_{t+2}  \label{eq:Fpi3}\\ \phantom{456}\vdots\phantom{3} & & \phantom{\ldots .}\vdots\phantom{\ldots} \nonumber\end{eqnarray}where $\epsilon_{t}$ is a transitory shock to the inflation rate inperiod $t$ while $\eta_{t}$ is the permanent innovation in thefundamental inflation rate $\pi^{f}_{t}$ in period $t$.  Now assumethat consumers believe that values of $\eta$ beyond period $t+1$, andvalues of $\epsilon$ beyond period $t$, are unforecastable white noisevariables; that is, future changes in the fundamental inflation rateare unforecastable, and transitory shocks are expected to goaway.\footnote{Note that we are allowing people to have some ideaabout how next quarter's fundamental rate may differ from the currentquarter's fundamental rate, because we did not impose that consumers'expectations of $\eta_{t+1}$ must equal zero.}% Is this plausible?  Cite the literatureBefore proceeding it is worth considering whether this is a plausibleview of the inflation process; we would not want to assume that peoplebelieve something patently absurd.  However, the near-unit-rootfeature of the inflation rate in the post-1959 period is well known toinflation researchers; some authors find that a unit root can berejected for some measures of inflation over some time periods, but itseems fair to say that the conventional wisdom is that at least sincethe late 1950s inflation is `close' to a unit root process.  SeeBarsky~\cite{barsky:fisher} for a more complete analysis, orBall~\cite{ball:nearrational} for a more recent treatment.% Not in conflict with the Phillips curveNote that the unit root (or near unit root) in inflation does not imply that future inflation rates are totally unpredictable, only that the history of inflation by itself is not very useful in forecasting future inflation {\it changes} (beyond the disappearance of the transitory component of the current period's shock).  This does not exclude the possibility that current and lagged values of other variables might have predictive power.  Thus, this view of the inflation rate is not necessarily in conflict with the vast and venerable literature showing that other variables (most notably the unemployment rate) do have considerable predictive power for the inflation rate (see Staiger, Stock, and Watson~\cite{ssw:nairu} for a recent treatment).% An ARIMA forecast is not optimal if the experts know somethingIf we were to assume that households were rational and made their owninflation forecasts solely based on observed past inflation under theassumption of an inflation process like\eqref{eq:Fpi}-\eqref{eq:Fpi2}, then the rational forecast would be ageometrically declining weighted average of past inflationrealizations; in this case rational expectations would be identical toadaptive expectations (Muth~\cite{muthOptimal}).  However, we willassume that households believe that {\it experts} have some ability todirectly estimate the past and present values of $\epsilon$ throughperiod $t$ and $\eta$ through period $t+1$ (through deeper knowledgeof how the economy works, or perhaps some private information); thushouseholds can rationally believe that a forecast from a professionalforecaster is more accurate than a simple adaptively rational forecastthat they could construct themselves.% Newspapers print forecast for next year; integrate into modelSuppose now that rather than containing a forecast for the entire quarter-by-quarter future history of the inflation rate, newspaper articles simply contain a forecast of the inflation rate over the next year.  The next step is to figure out how such a one-year forecast for inflation can be integrated into some modified version of equation~\eqref{eq:stickyerat}.  To capture this, we must introduce a bit more notation.  Define $\pi_{s,t}$ as the inflation rate between periods $s$ and $t$, converted to an annual rate.  Thus, for example, in quarterly data we can define the inflation rate for quarter $t+1$ at an annual rate as\begin{eqnarray*}	\pi_{t,t+1} & = & 4 (\log p_{t+1} - \log p_{t})\\  & = & 4 \pi_{t+1}	,\end{eqnarray*}where the factor of four is required to convert the quarterly price change to an annual rate.% What would people expect ex-post inflation rate to be?Our hypothetical person's view is that the true {\it ex-post} inflation rate over the next year will be given by\begin{eqnarray}    \pi_{t,t+4} & = & \pi_{t+1}+\pi_{t+2}+\pi_{t+3}+\pi_{t+4}  \label{eq:pittp4}\\   & = & \pi_{t+1}^{f}+\epsilon_{t+1}+\pi_{t+2}^{f}+\epsilon_{t+2}+\pi_{t+3}^{f}+\epsilon_{t+3}+\pi_{t+4}^{f}+\epsilon_{t+4} \nonumber \\   & = & \pi_{t+1}^{f}+\epsilon_{t+1}+\pi_{t+1}^{f}+\eta_{t+2}+\epsilon_{t+2}+\pi_{t+1}^{f}+\eta_{t+2}+\eta_{t+3}+\epsilon_{t+3}+ \nonumber\\   & & \pi_{t+1}^{f}+\eta_{t+2}+\eta_{t+3}+\eta_{t+4}+\epsilon_{t+4}.  \nonumber \end{eqnarray}% Define forecast of an updating agent as F[\bullet]Define $F_{t}[\bullet_{s}]$ as the agent's forecast (expectation) as of date $t$ of $\bullet_{s}$, for an agent who updates his views from a news report in period $t$.  Using this notation, the assumptions made earlier about the stochastic processes for $\epsilon$ and $\eta$ imply that \begin{equation}F_{t}[\epsilon_{t+n}]=F_{t}[\eta_{t+n+1}]=0 \label{eq:noise}\end{equation}for all $n>0$.  Applying the $F_{t}$ operator to both sidesof~\eqref{eq:pittp4} reveals that the person's forecast of theinflation rate over the next year is simply equal to four times hisforecast of the fundamental inflation rate for next quarter:\begin{eqnarray*}    F_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}] & = & 4 F_{t}[\pi_{t+1}^{f} ]\\  & = & F_{t}[\pi_{t,t+1}^{f}]    .%\\  & = & F_{t}[\pi_{t,t+1}]    \end{eqnarray*}% Thus, people should expect what is printed in the paper to be fundamental rateNow for an important conclusion: If people believe that the forecastsprinted in the newspaper embody the same view of the inflation processlaid out in equations~\eqref{eq:Fpi}-\eqref{eq:Fpi2} and\eqref{eq:noise}, then an identical analysis leads to the conclusionthat (defining the `newspaper expectations' operator $N_{t}$ similarlyto the consumer's expectations operator):\begin{eqnarray*}    N_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}] & = & 4 N_{t}[\pi_{t+1}^{f} ]\\  & = & N_{t}[\pi_{t,t+1}^{f}]    .%\\  & = & N_{t}[\pi_{t,t+1}]    \end{eqnarray*}Thus, from the consumer's point of view the newspaper forecastcontains only a single important piece of information: a projection ofthe fundamental inflation rate over the next year, which theprocess~\eqref{eq:Fpi}-\eqref{eq:Fpi2} process implies is theexpected fundamental rate in all of the year's constituent quartersand all subsequent quarters as well.  A consumer who reads thenewspaper in period $t$, therefore, will update his expectations toequal the corresponding newspaper forecasts:\begin{eqnarray*}    F_{t}[\pi_{t,t+1}] =  F_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}] = F_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}^{f}] & = & N_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}^{f} ] = N_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}].%\\  F_{t}[\pi_{t+1}] & = & N_{t}[\pi_{t+1}].\end{eqnarray*}The rightmost equality holds because the consumer assumes that for$n>0$, newspaper has no information about $\epsilon_{t+n}$ or$\eta_{t+n+1}$, so $N_{t}[\epsilon_{t+n}]=N_{t}[\eta_{t+n+1}]=0$.  Thenext equality to the left holds because we assume that when theconsumer reads the newspaper his views are updated to the viewsprinted in the newspaper.  The other two equalities similarly holdbecause $F_{t}[\epsilon_{t+n}]=F_{t}[\eta_{t+n+1}]=0$.Now note a crucial point: the assumption that changes in the inflationrate beyond period $t+1$ are unforecastable means that \begin{eqnarray}	F_{t-1}[\pi_{t-1,t+3}] & = & F_{t-1}[\pi_{t,t+4}] \label{eq:ftm1} \\	F_{t-2}[\pi_{t-2,t+2}] & = & F_{t-2}[\pi_{t,t+4}] \label{eq:ftm2} \\ 	\ldots & & \label{eq:ftmn} \nonumber\end{eqnarray}An equation similar to \eqref{eq:stickyerat} can be written for projections of the inflation rate over the next year:\begin{eqnarray*}	M_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}] & = & \lambda F_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}]	+(1-\lambda) \left\{ \lambda F_{t-1}[\pi_{t,t+4}]	+(1-\lambda)\left(\lambda F_{t-2}[\pi_{t,t+4}] 	+ \ldots\right) \right\} \nonumber,\end{eqnarray*}and substituting~\eqref{eq:ftm1}-\eqref{eq:ftm2} into this equationand replacing $F_{t}$ with $N_{t}$ on the assumption that the newspaperforecasts are the source of updating information, we obtain\begin{eqnarray}	M_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}] & = & \lambda F_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}]	+(1-\lambda) \left\{ \lambda F_{t-1}[\pi_{t-1,t+3}]	+(1-\lambda)\left( %\lambda F_{t-2}[\pi_{t-2,t+2}] 	\ldots\right) \right\} \nonumber \\ 	M_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}] & = & \lambda F_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}]	+(1-\lambda) M_{t-1}[\pi_{t-1,t+3}] \nonumber \\	M_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}] & = & \lambda N_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}]	+(1-\lambda) M_{t-1}[\pi_{t-1,t+3}]. \label{eq:esteqn}\end{eqnarray}% Mean inflation expectations are average of new and old viewsThat is, mean measured inflation expectations for the next year should be a weighted average between the current `rational' (or newspaper) forecast and last period's mean measured inflation expectations.  This equation is therefore directly estimable, assuming an appropriate proxy for newspaper expectations can be found.\footnote{This equation is basically the same as equation (5) in Roberts~\cite{roberts:inflexp}, except that Roberts proposes that the forecast toward which household expectations are moving is the `mathematically rational' forecast (and he simply proposes the equation without proposing a microfoundation that might produce it).}% If you don't like the derivation, here's what it buys Readers uncomfortable with the strong assumptions needed to derive~\eqref{eq:esteqn} may be happier upon noting that the equation\begin{eqnarray} M_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}] & = & \lambda N_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}] + (1-\lambda) M_{t-1}[\pi_{t,t+4}] \label{eq:pinoapprox}\end{eqnarray}can be derived without any assumptions on consumers' beliefs about the inflation process; the difference between~\eqref{eq:esteqn} and \eqref{eq:pinoapprox} is only in the subscript on the $\pi$ term inside the $M_{t-1}$ operator.  The assumptions made above were those necessary to rigorously obtain $M_{t-1}[\pi_{t,t+4}] = M_{t-1}[\pi_{t-1,t+3}]$.  In practice, however, even a much more realistic view of the inflation process would likely imply a very high degree of correlation between the period-$t-1$ projection of the inflation rate over the year beginning in quarter $t$ and the period-$t-1$ projection of the inflation rate over the year beginning in quarter $t+1$.  Indeed, three of out of the four quarters ($t+2, t+3, $ and $t+4$) are identical between the two projections; the only differences between the two measures would have to spring from the consumer's period-$t-1$ projection of the difference between the inflation rates in quarters $t+1$ and $t+5$.\section{Estimation}% Must identify data sourcesEstimating equation~\eqref{eq:esteqn} requires us to identify data sources for population-mean inflation expectations and for `newspaper' forecasts of inflation over the next year.% Michigan for HHsThe University of Michigan's Survey Research Center conducts a monthly survey of households that is intended to be representative of the population of the United States.  One component of the survey asks households what they expect the inflation rate to be over the next year.\footnote{Specifically, households are asked whether they think prices will go up, stay the same, or fall over the next year.  Those who say `go up' (the vast majority) are then asked `By about what percent do you expect prices to go up, on the average, during the next 12 months?'  For more details on the survey methodology, see Curtin~\cite{curtin:inflsurv}).} I will directly use the mean inflation forecast from this survey as my proxy for $M_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}]$.% SPF for NIdentifying the `newspaper' forecast for next-quarter inflation might seem more problematic, but there is a surprisingly good candidate: The mean four-quarter inflation forecast from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (henceforth, SPF).  The SPF, currently conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and previously a joint product of the National Bureau of Economic Research and the American Statistical Association, has collected and summarized forecasts from leading private forecasting firms since 1968.  The survey questionnaire is distributed once a quarter, just after the middle of the second month of the quarter, and responses are due within a couple of weeks.  The survey asks participants for quarter-by-quarter forecasts, spanning the current and next 5 quarters, for a wide variety of economic variables, including GDP growth, various measures of inflation including CPI inflation, and the unemployment rate.  For more details on the SPF, see Croushore~\cite{croushore:introSPF}.% Obvious candidates for N interviews are SPF forecastersAs noted above, the typical newspaper article on inflation interviews some `experts' on inflation.  The obvious candidates for such experts are the set of people who forecast the economy for a living, so the pool of interviewees is likely to be approximately the same group of forecasters whose views are summarized by the SPF. Hence, it seems reasonable to identify $N_{t}$ with the SPF inflation expectations data.\subsection{Do the Forecasts Forecast?}% Existing literature is mostly on rationality There is a substantial existing literature on the forecasting performance of various measures of inflation expectations including the Michigan Survey, the SPF, and an informal survey of economists known as the Livingston survey.\footnote{Unfortunately, the recent survey paper by Thomas~\cite{thomas:surveyinfl} largely neglects the SPF, and focuses instead mainly on comparisons of the Michigan survey and the Livingston survey.  Thomas finds the median of the Michigan survey to be a better forecaster than its mean, but my model delivers predictions only for the mean and not for the median, so I neglect the median forecast in my empirical work.} Early papers (Turnovsky~\cite{turnovsky:inflsurv}, Bryan and Gavin~\cite{bryan&gavin:inflsurv}) claimed to find statistically significant biases in some of the survey measures, but a recent review by Croushore~\cite{croushore:spfisgood} shows that some of those results were spurious (due to improper treatment of the data or econometric problems), and that the results claiming to reject rationality of the SPF fail to hold up when the sample period is updated to include data for the last 10 or 15 years.  Croushore specifically examines the CPI forecasts of both the Michigan survey and the SPF, and in a `forecast improvement' exercise finds evidence of systematic bias in the Michigan survey but not in the SPF. Roberts~\cite{roberts:stickyinfl} also finds that the Michigan survey's inflation expectations measure fails standard rationality tests.% Sniff testsThese results are suggestive, but are not precisely targeted on the question we are interested in: Whether the SPF forecast can be viewed as `more rational' than the Michigan forecast, and whether there is evidence that information moves from the SPF forecasters to the Michigan households but not vice versa.% Simplest measure is MSEOne of the simplest measures of forecast accuracy is the mean squarederror.  It is reassuring therefore that over the time period for whichboth SPF and Michigan forecasts are available, the {\it ex post} MSEof the SPF forecast is about 0.6 while the MSE for the Michigan surveyis almost twice as large, about 1.1.  (These are calculated by takingthe square of the difference between the respective mean forecasts andthe actual CPI core inflation over the corresponding time period.)% Do they have ANY forecasting power? YesA natural next question is whether each of the two surveys has meaningful forecasting power for future inflation, and if so, whether the SPF forecast is better.  As a first step, consider the implications of the near unit root in inflation.  High serial correlation means that future levels of the inflation rate will be highly predictable based on the recent past history of inflation.  Hence it is not very impressive to find that both surveys have highly significant predictive power for inflation (which they do), since this result could hold even if the forecasts were both mindless extrapolations of past inflation into the future.  The interesting question is whether the survey forecasts have predictive power for the future inflation rate {\it beyond} what could be predicted based on past inflation data.\ifthenelse{\boolean{FigsAndTablesInText}}{\input :DataAndPrograms:Data:piforc.tex}{}% Pi on E[Pi] and Pi laggedTo answer this question, Table~\ref{table:piforc} presents a regression of the actual inflation rate over the next year on the Michigan and SPF measures of expected inflation, along with the most recent annual inflation statistic available at the time the SPF and Michigan forecasts were made.  Both survey measures have highly statistically significant predictive power for future inflation even controlling for the inflation rate's recent past history, but the SPF measure has substantially more predictive power.  The `horserace' regression results indicate that the Michigan survey measure contains no information that is not also included in the SPF measure, while the SPF forecast has highly statistically significant predictive power that is not contained in the Michigan survey.\footnote{A more stringent test would be whether the surveys can predict the {\it change} in the inflation rate.  See Carroll~\cite{carroll:epidemicinflNBER} for this test, which again finds that both surveys have highly significant predictive power but the SPF has more power.  A more extensive evaluation of the forecasting power of the indexes is provided in the archive of programs that generated all of the results in this paper, available on the author's website.} Note that this result implies that the Michigan forecast is {\it prima facia} irrational (using the usual definition in rational expectations models), since the information that forecasters possessed that allowed them to make a superior forecast was in principle also available to households.  Thus, we can unambiguously conclude that the SPF forecast is `more rational' than the Michigan forecast, and the difference is large in both statistical and economic terms.% Next idea: Granger causalityA final preliminary check is suggested by the structure of the model, in which expectations are assumed to spread from forecasters to households.  This suggests that the professional forecasts should Granger-cause the household forecasts, but not vice versa.  Table~\ref{table:granger} shows that there is indeed statistical evidence of Granger causality from the professional forecasts to household forecasts, but no Granger causality in the opposite direction.\ifthenelse{\boolean{FigsAndTablesInText}}{\input :DataAndPrograms:Data:granger.tex}{}% Is SPF fully rational?  Who cares?Of course, a finding that the SPF forecast is better than the Michigan forecast does not necessarily imply that the SPF forecast is fully rational.  However, Croushore~\cite{croushore:spfisgood} reports results for a battery of optimality tests proposed in the {\it Handbook of Statistics} by Diebold and Lopez~\cite{diebold&lopez:forecastbias}; the SPF fails only one of these tests, the DuFour test, which is actually partly a test of the symmetry of the forecast errors around zero.  Since nothing in rational expectations theory requires errors to be symmetrically distributed, this test is arguably of less interest than the other tests.  Finally, note that the question of the rationality of the SPF forecasts is logically separate from the enterprise here, which is to examine whether the Michigan forecasts can be well modeled as updating toward the SPF forecasts.  Rationality of the SPF forecasts is interesting in and of itself, but is in principle an independent question that can be addressed separately (as in Croushore~\cite{croushore:spfisgood}).\subsection{Estimating the Stickiness of Inflation Expectations}% Does the model work (provide a decent description of data)?We now turn to the main question, which is whether the Michigan survey data can be reasonably well represented by the model~\eqref{eq:esteqn}.\ifthenelse{\boolean{FigsAndTablesInText}}{\input :DataAndPrograms:Data:esteqn.tex}{}To provide a baseline for comparison, the first line of Table~\ref{table:esteqn} presents results for the simplest possible model: that the value of the Michigan index $M_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}]$ is equal to a constant, $\alpha_{0}$.  By definition the $\bar{R}^{2}$ is equal to zero; the standard error of the estimate is 0.88.  The last column of the table is reserved for reporting the results of various tests that will be conducted as the analysis progresses.  By way of example, the test performed for the benchmark expectations-constant model is whether the average value of the expectations index is zero, $\alpha_{0} = 0$.  Unsurprisingly, this nonsensical proposition can be rejected with an overwhelming degree of statistical confidence, as indicated by a $p$-value that says that the probability that the proposition is true is zero.% Estimate unrestricted versionWe begin to examine the baseline model's ability to explain the Michigandata by estimating\begin{eqnarray}	M_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}] & = & \alpha_{1}S_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}]+\alpha_{2}M_{t}[\pi_{t-1,t+3}]+\nu_{t}, \label{eq:firstest}\end{eqnarray} where $S_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}]$ is the corresponding SPF forecast.  Comparing this to \eqref{eq:esteqn} provides the testable restriction that $\alpha_{2}=1-\alpha_{1}$ or, equivalently,\begin{equation}\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}=1 \label{eq:restriction}.\end{equation}% Restriction easily accepted; when imposed, \lambda =0.27Results from the estimation of \eqref{eq:firstest} are presented as equation 1.  The point estimates of $\alpha_{1}=0.36$ and $\alpha_{2}=0.66$ suggest that the restriction \eqref{eq:restriction} is very close to holding true, and the last column presents formal statistical evidence on the question: It shows that the statistical significance with which the proposition that $\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}=1$ can be rejected is only about 0.18, so that the restriction is easily accommodated by the data at the conventional level of significance of 0.05 or greater.  Estimation results when the restriction is imposed in estimation are presented in the next row of the table, which provides our first unambiguous estimate of the crucial coefficient: $\lambda= 0.27$.  Note that the Durbin-Watson statistic indicates that there is no evidence of serial correlation in the residuals (a Q-test yields the same result), which is impressive because the individual series involved have very high degrees of serial correlation.  This is evidence that the two variables are cointegrated, as would be expected if one were a distributed lag of the other.% Estimate is 0.27 cf M&R 0.25The point estimate $\lambda=0.27$ is remarkably close to the value of $0.25$ assumed by Mankiw and Reis~\cite{mankiw&reis:slumps,mankiw&reis:stickye} in their simulation experiments; unsurprisingly, the last column for equation 2 indicates that the proposition $\alpha_{1}=\lambda=0.25$ is easily accepted by the data.  This estimate indicates that in each quarter, only about one fourth of households have a completely up-to-date forecast of the inflation rate over the coming year.  On the other hand, it also indicates that only about 32 percent ($=(1-0.25)^{4})$ of households have inflation expectations that are more than a year out of date.% Comparison to RobertsAs noted above, Roberts~\cite{roberts:inflexp} estimated a similar equation, except that his proposal was that expectations move toward the mathematically rational forecast of inflation rather than toward the SPF measure.  Since the `rational' forecast is unobservable, he used the actual inflation rate and instrumented using a set of predetermined instruments, on the usual view that if the instruments are valid the estimation should yield an unbiased estimate of the coefficient on the true but unobservable rational forecast.  However, this procedure is problematic if there was anything that the `rational' forecaster did not know about the structure of the economy and had to learn from realizations over time; as Roberts acknowledges, it is also problematic if the structure of the economy changes over time.  A final drawback to this approach is that instrumenting can cause a severe loss of efficiency.  Since the theory proposed here is quite literally that household expectations move toward the SPF forecast, there is no reason to instrument.  In the end, however, Roberts's parameter estimates are similar to those obtained here, though with considerably larger standard errors.% If you force the data to fit the model, they say OKWhat equation 2 of Table~\ref{table:esteqn} indicates is that if the data are forced to choose an $\alpha_{1}=1-\alpha_{2}$ they are happy with that restriction, and that a model that imposes the restriction has a highly statistically significant ability to fit the data.  However, we have not allowed the data to speak to the question of whether there is a better representation of inflation expectations than \eqref{eq:firstest}.% But if we let a constant in, it wants to be there and positiveThe first avenue by which we might wish to let the data reject the specification is to allow a constant into the equation.  Equation 3 presents the results.  The last column indicates that the proposition that the constant term is zero can be rejected at a very high level of statistical significance; on the other hand, the improvement in fit that comes with a constant is rather modest: The standard error declines from about 0.43 without the constant to about 0.35 with it.  Compared with a raw standard error for the dependent variable of about 0.88, this improvement in fit is not very impressive, even if it is statistically significant.% But a model with a positive constant doesn't make senseFurthermore, if the model is to be treated as a structural descriptionof the true process by which inflation expectations are formed, thepresence of a constant term does not make much sense.  It implies, forexample, that if both actual inflation and the rational forecast forinflation were to go to zero forever, people would continue to expecta positive inflation rate (of a bit under 2 percent) forever.  Itseems much more likely that under these circumstances people wouldeventually learn to expect an inflation rate of zero.  This point canbe generalized to show that if the actual inflation rate and therational forecast were fixed forever at {\it any} constant value,people's expectations would never converge to the true, constantinflation rate, but instead would be perpetually biased (unless thetrue value happened to be exactly equal to the unique stable point ofthe estimated equation).% The more elaborate epidemiological model can explain a constantA more palatable explanation for the presence of a constant term isthat the baseline model is not a perfectly accuratedescription of the process by which information is transmitted in theeconomy; in this case estimation of the misspecified model couldresult in a spuriously significant coefficient term.  For example,Carroll~\cite{carroll:epidemicinflSFI} demonstrates that the presenceof a significant constant term could reflect the presence of somesocial transmission of inflation expectations via conversations withneighbors (epidemiologically, the disease is locally communicable), inaddition to the news-media channel examined here.% Allowing adaptive rather than rational expectations doesn't workAnother plausible modification to the model is to allow for thepossibility that some people update their expectations to the mostrecent {\it past} inflation rate rather than to the SPF forecast ofthe future inflation rate.  Since most news coverage of inflation isprompted by the release of past inflation statistics (and since thenew past number is often in the headline of the news article) onemight argue that it might seem {\it more} likely for people to updatetheir expectations to the past inflation rate than to a forecast ofthe future rate.  This coresponds to what is usually called a model of`adaptive expectations.'  As noted above, however, if people believethat the true inflation process is as described in\eqref{eq:Fpi}-\eqref{eq:Fpi2}, this adaptive expectations benchmarkis also identical to the limited-information rational expectationsforecast (again, remember that we are assuming that households believeprofessional forecasters know much more about the inflation processthan is contained in its past history, so updating households couldstill believe that the SPF forecast is better than the adaptivelyrational forecast would be).We can examine these possibilities by estimating an equation of theform\begin{eqnarray}	M_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}] & = & \alpha_{1} S_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}]+\alpha_{2} M_{t-1}[\pi_{t-1,t+3}]+\alpha_{3} P_{t}[\pi_{t-5,t-1}],\end{eqnarray}where $P_{t}[\pi_{t-5,t-1}]$ represents the most recently published annual inflation rate as of time $t$.% Allow horserace with adaptive expectationsResults from estimating this equation are presented in the next row of Table~\ref{table:esteqn}.  The past inflation rate is indeed highly statistically significant - but with a {\it negative} coefficient!  The negative coefficient makes no sense, as it implies that a higher past inflation rate convinces people that the fundamental inflation rate is lower.  The final row of the table, however, shows that when a constant is included in this regression, the past inflation rate is no longer statistically significant, while the forecast of the future inflation rate remains highly statistically significant.  This seems to indicate that the significance of the past inflation rate is spurious, in the sense that the past inflation rate is just proxying for the missing constant term, which we have already acknowledged to be statistically significant.  The last row in the table shows, surprisingly, that even when the SPF forecast is entirely absent, the lagged inflation rate has no explanatory power for the Michigan survey after controlling for the lagged value of the survey; furthermore, the Durbin-Watson suggests a substantial amount of negative serial correlation in the residuals of this equation, in contrast with the baseline model.% One caveat - timing does not match up very well% Model does pretty wellIn sum, it seems fair to say that the simple `sticky expectations'equation~\eqref{eq:esteqn} does a remarkably good job of capturingmuch of the predictable behavior of the Michigan inflationexpectations index.\footnote{One further robustness test is presentedin Carroll~\cite{carroll:epidemicinflNBER}: Estimation of the model onmonthly rather than quarterly data.  This gets around the timingproblems caused by the fact that the Michigan index for a quarterreflects interviews continuously throughout the quarter while the SPFreflects forecasters' views at a point in time roughly halfway throughthe quarter.  Estimates of the monthly $\lambda$ are roughly a thirdthe size of estimates of the quarterly rate, as would be expected ifthe quarterly estimates were unbiased.}\subsection{Inflation News Coverage and Inflation Expectations}% When there are more news stories, people should be better informedIf we take literally the assumption that people derive their inflationexpectations from news stories, we should expect that when there aremore news stories people should be better informed. Figure~\ref{fig:inflfigs} plots an index of the intensity of newscoverage of inflation in the New York Times and the Washington Postagainst the actual inflation rate;\footnote{The index was constructedas follows.  For each newspaper $i \in \{\mbox{New YorkTimes},\mbox{Washington Post}\}$, for each year $t$ since 1980 (whenthe Nexis index of both newspapers begins), a search was performed forstories that began on the front page of the newspaper and containedwords beginning with the root `inflation' (so that, for example,`inflationary' or `inflation-fighting' would be picked up).  For eachnewspaper, the number of stories was converted to an index rangingbetween zero and 1 by dividing the number of stories in a given yearby the maximumn number of inflation stories in any year.  Thus, thefact that the overall index falls to about 0.25 in the last part ofthe sample indicates that there were about a quarter as manyfront-page stories about inflation in this time period as there wereat the maximum.} unsurprisingly, the intensity of news coverage ofinflation was highest in the early 1980s when the actual inflationrate was very high, and inflation coverage has generally declinedsince then.  Note, however, that the actual inflation rate fellfarther and faster than the news index; evidently, inflation remainedan important story during the period when it was dropping rapidly.\ifthenelse{\boolean{FigsAndTablesInText}}{\input :DataAndPrograms:Data:inflfigs.tex}{}%\begin{figure} \centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{:DataAndPrograms:Data:inflmicvsspf.eps}}%\epsfbox{:DataAndPrograms:Data:inflindex.eps}} \caption{Michigan Versus SPF Forecasts of Inflation} \label{fig:inflmicvsspf}\end{figure}% Plot actual vs forecasts of inflThe bottom panel of Figure~\ref{fig:inflfigs} plots the SPF and Michigan forecasts since the third quarter of 1981 when the SPF first began to include CPI inflation.  One striking feature of the figure is that during the high-news-coverage period of the early 1980s, the size of the gap between the SPF forecast and the Michigan forecast is distinctly smaller than the gap in the later period when there was less news coverage of inflation.% Formal test of whether GAP is related to NEWSA formal statistical test of whether greater news coverage is associated with `more rational' household forecasts (in the sense of forecasts that are closer to the SPF forecast) can be constructed as follows.  Defining the square of the gap between the Michigan and SPF forecasts as GAPSQ$_{t} = (M_{t}-S_{t})^{2}$, and defining the inflation index as NEWS$_{t}$, we can estimate the simple OLS regression equation\begin{eqnarray}\mbox{GAPSQ}_{t} & = & \alpha_{0} + \alpha_{1} \mbox{NEWS}_{t}.\end{eqnarray}% Gap is indeed lower when news is higherTable~\ref{table:erronnews} presents the results.  Estimated over the entire sample from 1981q3 to 2000q2 the regression finds a negative relationship that is statistically significant at the 5 percent level after correcting for serial correlation.  The second row shows that that if the first year of the SPF CPI forecasts is excluded the negative relationship is much stronger and statistically significant at better than the 1 percent level; however, aside from the possibility that the first few SPF CPI forecasts were problematic in some way, there seems to be little reason to exclude the first year of SPF data.\ifthenelse{\boolean{FigsAndTablesInText}}{\input :DataAndPrograms:Data:erronnews.tex}{}% Test direct implication: higher infection rate when more storiesThe finding that household inflation forecasts are better when thereis more news coverage is an indirect implication of the model underthe assumption that absorption of the SPF forecast is more likely whenthere is more inflation coverage.  The proposition that the absorptionrate is higher when there are more news stories can also be testeddirectly.  Table~\ref{table:newslam} presents estimation resultscomparing the absorption rate estimated during periods when there ismore news coverage than average (NEWS$_{t}>$mean(NEWS)) and lesscoverage than average (NEWS$_{t}<$mean(NEWS)).  The estimate of$\lambda$ is almost 0.7 during periods of intensive news coverage, butonly about 0.2 during periods of less intense coverage; an F-testindicates that this difference in coefficients is statisticallysignificant at the 5 percent level (and nearly at the 1 percentlevel).\ifthenelse{\boolean{FigsAndTablesInText}}{\input :DataAndPrograms:Data:newslam.tex}{}% Existing lit: ADPThere are several strands of the existing literature that deservecomment at this point.  In two important recent papers, Akerlof,Dickens, and Perry~\cite{adp:one,adp:two} have proposed a model inwhich workers do not bother to inform themselves about the inflationrate unless inflation gets high enough that ignorance would becomecostly.  Since periods of high news coverage have coincided withperiods of high inflation, this model is obviously consistent with thefinding that mean inflation expectations are more rational duringperiods of high coverage.  Indeed, in a way the ADP models are deeperthan the one proposed here, because they provide an explanation forthe intensity of news coverage which is taken as exogenous here: Thenews media write more stories on inflation in periods when workers aremore interested in the topic.% Existing lit: RobertsThese results can also be viewed as somewhat similar to some findings by Roberts~\cite{roberts:inflexp}, who estimates a model like~\eqref{eq:esteqn}, performs a sample split, and finds the speed of adjustment parameter much larger in the post-1976 period than in the pre-76 era.  He interprets this as bad news for the model.  However, the pre-76 era was one of much more stable inflation (until the last years) than the post-76 era, so the finding of a higher coefficient in the later years is very much in the spirit of the tests performed above, and is therefore consistent with the interpretation of the model proposed here.% BMR and DKW\section{Unemployment Expectations}% To be generally useful, needs to work for things other than inflationIf the model of expectations proposed here is to be generally useful to macroeconomists, it will need to apply to other variables in addition to inflation.  Another potential candidate is unemployment expectations; in previous work (Carroll~\cite{carroll:brookings}, Carroll and Dunn~\cite{carroll&dunn:macroannual}) I have found unemployment expectations to be a powerful predictor of household spending decisions, and since household spending accounts for two thirds of GDP, understanding the dynamics of unemployment expectations (and any deviations from rationality) should have considerable direct interest.% Michigan survey question doesn't ask the level of unemploymentUnfortunately, however, the Michigan survey's question on unemployment does not ask households to name a specific figure for the future unemployment rate; instead, households are asked whether they expect the unemployment rate to rise, stay the same, or fall over the next year.  Traditionally, the answers to these questions are converted into an index by subtracting the ``fall'' from the ``rise'' proportion.  This diffusion index can then be converted into a forecast of the change in the unemployment rate by using the predicted value from a regression of the actual change in unemployment on the predicted change.% Explain construction of unemployment forecastThat is, the regression\begin{eqnarray}\bar{U}_{t,t+4}-\bar{U}_{t-4,t} & = & \gamma_{0} + \gamma_{1}M_{t}^{U} \label{eq:duonmichu}\end{eqnarray}is estimated, where $\bar{U}_{t,t+4}$ is the average unemployment rate over the next year and $\bar{U}_{t-4,t}$ is the unemployment rate over the year to the present, and $M_{t}^{U}$ is the Michigan index of unemployment expectations.  With the estimated $\{\hat{\gamma}_{0},\hat{\gamma}_{1}\}$ in hand a forecast of next year's unemployment rate can be constructed from\begin{eqnarray}\hat{\bar{U}}_{t,t+4} & = & \hat{\gamma}_{0} + \hat{\gamma}_{1}M_{t}^{U}+\bar{U}_{t-4,t}.\end{eqnarray}% MU has lots of power for U, but not when SPF is controlled forWhen~\eqref{eq:duonmichu} is estimated, the coefficient on $M_{t}^{U}$ is has a t-statistic of over 8, even after correcting for serial correlation.  However, in a horserace regression of the actual change in unemployment on the Michigan diffusion index and the SPF forecast of the change in unemployment, the Michigan forecast has no predictive power.  Thus, as with inflation, it appears that on average people have considerable information about how the unemployment rate is likely to change, but forecasters know a lot more than households do.% Results for U analogy to esteqn Table~\ref{table:esteqnunemp} presents a set of regression results for the household unemployment forecast that is essentially identical to the tests performed in Table~\ref{table:esteqn} for inflation expectations.\ifthenelse{\boolean{FigsAndTablesInText}}{\input :DataAndPrograms:Data:esteqn_unemp.tex}{}% Works greatThe point estimate of the speed of adjustment parameter in row 3 is$\alpha_{1}=0.31$; the test reported in the last column of that rowindicates that this is statistically indistinguishable from theestimate of $\lambda=0.25$ obtained for inflation expectations.  Inmost respects, in fact, the model performs even better in explainingunemployment expectations than explaining inflation expectations.  Forexample, row 3 indicates that the equation does not particularly wanta constant term in it, while row 4 finds that the lagged level of theunemployment rate has no predictive power for current expectationseven when a constant is excluded.% But interpretation is rather dicey \ldotsNonetheless, this evidence should be considered with some caution. The process of constructing the forecast for the average future levelof the unemployment rate, while apparently reasonable, may beeconometrically and conceptually problematic.  In particular, thismethod assumes that the {\it amount} by which unemployment is expectedto change on average is related to the {\it proportion} of people whoexpect unemployment to rise or fall; in fact, there is no necessarylinear relationship between these two quantities.  Other econometricdifficulties may come from the use of constructed variables on boththe left and right hand sides of the equation.  I view this model ofunemployment expectations merely as secondary supporting evidence forthe expectations modeling strategy pursued here, and therefore am notinclined to pursue these conceptual and econometric problems further,though they might be worth pursuing in later work.\section{Discussion and Relationship to Existing Literature}% Why HH exps matter: wage-push inflationA potential criticism of this paper might be that expectations ofhouseholds are unimportant for macroeconomic outcomes; instead,perhaps what matters are expectations of experts, which may berational in the traditional sense.  This is not a plausible criticismwith respect to unemployment expectations, given the powerfulinfluence that households' unemployment expectations have on householdspending (Carroll and Dunn~\cite{carroll&dunn:macroannual});households' consumption decisions surely depend on their own viewsrather than the views of others.  In the case of inflationexpectations, whether households' expectations are importantpresumably depends on whether sluggish household expectations arepartly or largely responsible for the costly nature of disinflations. This seems a good guess, since credible preannounced disinflationsshould be costless (or nearly so) in an economy in which all agentshave rational expectations (Ball~\cite{ball:sacrifice}).  It seemslikely that a good part of the influence of household expectations oninflation comes through a labor market channel.  Standard models ofunemployment, either in the search literature or the efficiency wageliterature, almost always rely upon an assumption that households'labor supply decisions are made by judging the appeal of available orexpected real wage offers.  It is an empirical fact that wagecontracts are usually written in nominal terms, so these models ofcyclical and structural unemployment entail an implicit assumptionthat households can translate nominal wage offers into real ones,which requires them to have expectations about inflation.  Since wagesare around two thirds of business costs, if households' inflationexpectations affect nominal wage outcomes they must affect firms'pricing decisions through the usual `wage-push' channel.% Relationship to credibility literatureThe potential importance of household expectations provides a newperspective on the ongoing debate about the importance of`credibility' in monetary policy.  Credibility has usually beenthought of in terms of the beliefs of policy experts and privateforecasters; for example, an extensive recent treatment in Bernankeet.  al.~\cite{blmp:infltarget} judges credibility of inflationtargeting regimes by examining how quickly professional forecastsconverge to the stated target range.  Indeed, some central banks (suchas the Bank of England and the Bank of Israel) have begun toofficially look at surveys of forecasters as well as yields oninflation indexed bonds as measures of such ``expert'' opinion. However, empirical tests of whether credibility matters for monetarypolicy have produced mixed results; see, e.g.,Posen~\cite{posen:cred2,posen:cred} or Debelle andFischer~\cite{debelle&fischer:cred}, and for an insider's perspectiveand an excellent summary of the literature seeBlinder~\cite{blinder:centbank}.  The results above, however, indicatethat there are substantial gaps between beliefs of forecasters and ofhouseholds, so credibility among experts may not be sufficient toachieve a desired inflationary outcome; the views of the experts needto be communicated effectively to the population to become effective.% Add price stickiness tooIn many cases the model is likely to yield similar, though notidentical, conclusions to those obtained from models with pricestickiness.  Consider, for example, the finding of Ball, Mankiw, andRomer~\cite{bmr:phillips} that the Phillips curve is steeper wheninflation is higher, which they attribute to a reduction in pricestickiness at high inflation rates (a futher justification of sucheffects can be found in the recent paper by Dotsey, King, andWolman~\cite{dkw:Ss}).  If the newsworthiness of inflation forecastsdepends on the level of inflation and $\lambda$ reflects the intensityof news coverage, then very similar implications could be derived inthis model.  However, the two interpretations could be distinguishedif newsworthiness is related to the {\it change} in inflation (asfigure~\ref{fig:inflfigs} suggests).A related question is why it appears to be easier to end highinflations than moderate ones(Sargent~\cite{sargent:biginfl,sargent:modinfl}): Perhaps the attentionof the population tends to be intensely focused on governmentinflation-fighting policies during hyperinflations (so $\lambda = 1$and the model collapses to rational expectations), while attention maybe focused on other matters during attempts to end moderateinflations.  Ball~\cite{ball:sacrifice} shows that quickerdisinflations seem to entail smaller sacrifices of output; again, thiscould reflect the fact that the policies needed to achieve a quickdisinflation are more dramatic, and therefore more newsworthy, than ina gradualist approach.  One way of testing these ideas for morerecent episodes would be to construct indices of news coverage ofinflation like those presented above for other countries duringdisinflationary episodes.%Of course, the real world presumably combines some degree of pricestickiness and a degree of expectational stickiness.  The results inBall~\cite{ball:credibility} showing strong interactions betweencredibility and price stickiness suggest that a model that combinessticky expectations and sticky prices might generate results differentfrom the results obtainable with either feature alone; this would alsobe an interesting topic for future research.\section{Conclusions}Given the consensus among economists that macroeconomic outcomesdepend critically on agents' expectations, it is surprising that therehas been very little effort to test positive models of expectationsusing the large body of empirical expectations data available from theMichigan Survey and the Conference Board.This paper shows that a very simple model in which the typicalhousehold's expectations are updated probabilistically toward theviews of professional forecasters does a good job of capturing much ofthe variation in the Michigan Survey's measures of inflation andunemployment expectations.  In addition to fitting these data, themodel can be interpreted as providing microfoundations for theaggregate expectations equation postulated recently by Mankiw andReis~\cite{mankiw&reis:slumps,mankiw&reis:stickye} and earlier byRoberts~\cite{roberts:inflexp}.  As those papers show, macroeconomicdynamics are more plausible in a variety of dimensions, including thetradeoff between inflation and unemployment, the reaction of theeconomy to monetary shocks, and the relationship between productivitygrowth and unemployment, when expectations deviate in this way fromthe rational expectations benchmark.There are many directions in which research could fruitfully proceedfrom here.  First, the Michigan and Conference Board surveys containmany other expectational variables that could be studied to seewhether the specification proposed here is widely applicable.  Second,the model could be tested at the micro level using the rawhousehold-level data from the surveys.  (One approach would be toextend the model of Branch~\cite{branch:hetero}, in which individualschoose among various alternative predictors, to include the SPFforecast among the competing predictors).  Third, the implications ofmore sophisticated models of the spread of expectations in thepopulation can be examined (see Carroll~\cite{carroll:epidemicinflSFI}for a start).  And much more work remains to be done to investigatethe empirical and theoretical properties of macroeconomic models inwhich expectations are formed in this way.Finally, it is clear that in order for this framework to be a completeand general purpose tool, it will be necessary to develop a theorythat explains the variations in the absorbtion parameter $\lambda$over time.  For present purposes it was enough to show that $\lambda$is related to the intensity of news coverage, but that only pushes theproblem one step back, to the need for a model of the extent of newscoverage.  Possibly the approach offered in a recent paper bySims~\cite{sims:inattention} could help; Sims examines models of`rational inattention' which imply that an agent with limitedinformation processing capacity should optimally ignore mostmacroeconomic data.  The difficulty with applying the Sims frameworkto consumers directly is that solving the problem of deciding what toignore is even harder than solving the full-information rationalexpectations model.  However, if the news media were viewed as theagents who solve the information compression problem (since theinformation stream they can convey is obviously limited), the Simsframework might provide a useful formal model of how the news media goabout deciding how much coverage to give to economic matters.\medskip\medskip\medskip{\sc The Johns Hopkins University}\input MacPocketDrive:Software:latex:texhtml\pagebreak\vfill\eject\ifthenelse{\boolean{QJETypesetVersion}}{   \newpage\begingroup   \setlength{\parindent}{0pt}   \setlength{\parskip}{2ex}%   \def{\enotesize}{\normalsize}   \theendnotes   \endgroup}\pagebreak\vfill\eject\bibliographystyle{MacPocketDrive:Software:latex:qje}\bibliography{MacPocketDrive:Software:latex:economics}\ifthenelse{\boolean{FigsAndTablesInText}}{}{\pagebreak%\input :DataAndPrograms:Data:ADFpi.tex\input :DataAndPrograms:Data:piforc.tex\input :DataAndPrograms:Data:granger.tex\input :DataAndPrograms:Data:esteqn.tex\input :DataAndPrograms:Data:erronnews.tex\input :DataAndPrograms:Data:newslam.tex\input :DataAndPrograms:Data:esteqn_unemp.tex%\input :DataAndPrograms:Data:estonsim.tex%\input :DataAndPrograms:Data:estran.tex%\input :DataAndPrograms:Data:estnbr.tex\pagebreak\input :DataAndPrograms:Data:inflfigs.tex%\input :DataAndPrograms:Data:inflstd.tex%\input :DataAndPrograms:Data:inflstdlogerr.tex}\end{document}\pagebreak\vfill\ejectThe ancient Greek philosopher Xenophanes once observed that if oxen had artistic talent, the gods they would paint would look like oxen instead of like Apollo or Aphrodite.  Xenophanes might not have been surprised to learn that the agents with whom economists populate their models are essentially godlike versions of economists: infinitely knowledgable and infinitely rational and deeply interested in the structure and workings of the economy.  However, in a twist that surely would have surprised even Xenophanes, we assume that these godlike creatures are a good representation of the average person or business manager.\begin{eqnarray}	M_{t}[\pi_{t+1}] & = & \lambda N_{t}[\pi_{t+1}] + (1-\lambda)\lambda E_{t-1}[\pi_{t+1}]+(1-\lambda)^{2} \lambda E_{t-2}[\pi_{t+1}] + \ldots .\end{eqnarray}\begin{eqnarray*}	\pi_{t-4,t} & = & \pi_{t-3}+\pi_{t-2}+\pi_{t-1}+\pi_{t}  \\	 & = & F_{t-3}[\pi_{t-3}]+\epsilon_{t-3}+F_{t-2}[\pi_{t-2}]+\epsilon_{t-2}   +F_{t-1}[\pi_{t-1}]+\epsilon_{t-1}+F_{t}[\pi_{t}]+\epsilon_{t}\\   & = & 4 F_{t-3}[\pi_{t-3}]	+ 3 \eta_{t-2}+2\eta_{t-1}+\eta_{t}+ \epsilon_{t-3}+\epsilon_{t-2}+\epsilon_{t-1}+\epsilon_{t}\end{eqnarray*}and analogously \begin{eqnarray*}	\pi_{t,t+4} & = & 4 F_{t+1}[\pi_{t+1}]	+ 3 \eta_{t+2}+2\eta_{t+3}+\eta_{t}+ \epsilon_{t+1}+\epsilon_{t+2}+\epsilon_{t+3}+\epsilon_{t+4}\\ & = & 4 F_{t-3}[\pi_{t-3}]+4(\eta_{t-2}+\eta_{t-1}+\eta_{t}+\eta_{t+1})+ 3 \eta_{t+2}+2\eta_{t+3}+\eta_{t}\\ &   & + \epsilon_{t+1}+\epsilon_{t+2}+\epsilon_{t+3}+\epsilon_{t+4}\end{eqnarray*}Consider how the inflation rateIf inflation is indeed a unit root process with a white noise transitory component, then the inflation rate over the next year will be\begin{eqnarray*}	\pi_{t,t+4} & = & F_{t}[\pi_{t+1}]+\epsilon_{t+1}+F_{t+2}[\pi_{t+2}]+\epsilon_{t+2}+ F_{t+3}[\pi_{t+3}]+\epsilon_{t+3}+F_{t+4}[\pi_{t+4}]+\epsilon_{t+4}	\\	 & = & 4 F_{t}[\pi_{t}]+4\eta_{t+1}+3 \eta_{t+2}+2\eta_{t+3}+\eta_{t+1}+\epsilon_{t+1}+\epsilon_{t+2}+\epsilon_{t+3}+\epsilon_{t+4}%\\	 & = & F_{t}[\pi_{t-1,t}]+\chi_{t,t+4}\end{eqnarray*}where $E_{t}[\eta_{t+1}]=E_{t}[\eta_{t+2}]=E_{t}[\epsilon_{t+1}]=E_{t}[\epsilon_{t+2}]=\ldots=0$ implies that $\chi_{t,t+4}$ is a white noise error term.  That is, the only element of predictability in future inflation rates comes from the fact that the future fundamental rate is equal to the current fundamental rate plus some white noise innovations.Now consider a regressionof the inflation rate over the next year on the inflation rate for thecurrent quarter:\begin{eqnarray}	\pi_{t,t+4} & = & \alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1} \pi_{t-1,t}\\  F_{t}[\pi_{t-1,t}]+\chi_{t,t+4}            	& = & \alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1} (F_{t}[\pi_{t-1,t}]+\epsilon_{t})\\  F_{t}[\pi_{t-1,t}]            	& = & \alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1} (F_{t}[\pi_{t-1,t}]+\epsilon_{t})-\chi_{t,t+4}\end{eqnarray}If the variance of the transitory component of inflation were zero, the regression should  then the only predictable element of the difference between inflation over the next year and inflation in the current quarter would come from the $-4\epsilon_{t}$ term.  Table~\ref{table:survforecast} presents evidence on these questions.  The first two rows show that both the Michigan inflation expectations index and the SPF forecast have highly statistically significant predictive power for the core inflation rate, even when the lagged core inflation rate is included as a regressor; indeed, in neither case is the lagged inflation rate statistically significant, which indicates that both survey measures already incorporate any information contained in the lagged inflation rate.\footnote{The Durbin-Watson and Q statistics indicate that there is a substantial amount of serial correlation in the residuals from these equations, so the standard errors are adjusted using the Newey-West correction with 8 lags and a damping factor of 1.}$^{,}$\footnote{It might seem that this evidence that the Michigan index can forecast the change in the inflation rate contradicts the assumption that people believe inflation follows a random walk.  In fact, however, there is no contradiction.  In our model, people believe that future fundamental inflation rates follow a random walk beginning in period $t+1$.  But their views of the inflation rate for period $t+1$ are not constrained to be a random innovation with respect to the actual inflation rate in period $t$, for two reasons.  First, we assumed that people in period $t$ believe that $F_{t}[\pi_{t+1}]$ is equal to the rational forecast $E_{t}[\pi_{t+1}]$, and there is no restriction on how the rational forecast may differ from the recent level of inflation; in particular, the rational forecast may be influenced, for example, by the level of the unemployment rate.  Second, people in this model know that any transitory inflation shocks in period $t$ will disappear for future periods.} The third row of the table shows that when both survey measures are included in the forecasting equation, the Michigan survey measure has no information about the future inflation rate that is not contained in the SPF forecast, while the SPF forecast has considerable and highly statistically significant predictive power not contained in the Michigan forecast.  The SPF's victory is made more impressive by the fact that the SPF forecast is constructed in the middle of the second month of the quarter, and therefore by construction cannot incorporate any information released during the latter half of the quarter, while the Michigan survey measure for the corresponding quarter includes results from interviews up to the last day of the quarter.  The fact that the SPF contains considerably more forecasting power despite its substantial timing disadvantage bolsters the proposition that the SPF forecast is considerably better than the Michigan forecast.An alternative way to examine the rationality and efficiency of the two forecasts is to ask about the ability of the two surveys to forecast the {\it change} in the inflation rate.  In a statistical sense this can be viewed as a tougher challenge than forecasting the level of the inflation rate; after all, if the inflation rate really has a unit root (which we could not reject above), then the level of the inflation rate would be highly forecastable but changes in the inflation rate (beyond the current quarter) would be totally unforecastable.  The next three panels of the table therefore regress the change in the annual inflation rate between the present and one year in the future on the SPF and Michigan survey's forecasts of that change.  That is, \begin{eqnarray*}	\pi_{t-4,t} & = & \pi_{t-3}+\pi_{t-2}+\pi_{t-1}+\pi_{t}  \\	 & = & F_{t-3}[\pi_{t-3}]+F_{t-2}[\pi_{t-2}]+F_{t-1}[\pi_{t-1}]+F_{t}[\pi_{t}]  \\	 &  & + \epsilon_{t-3}+\epsilon_{t-2}+\epsilon_{t-1}+\epsilon_{t}\end{eqnarray*}\begin{eqnarray*}	F_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}] & = & 4 F_{t}[\pi_{t+1}]\end{eqnarray*}Comparing these two expressions, it is evident that there are severalAgain, both surveys contain highly statistically significant information, but again the SPF forecast is substantially better than the Michigan forecast.\footnote{In principle, such predictability could reflect either time aggregation problems or the modest predictability that comes from knowing that the current transitory components of inflation will disappear.  The }Now we can integrate the fact that experts have some ability to predict the future inflation rate with the person's view that the inflation process has a unit root by supposing that when people update their views about the fundamental inflation rate they update to what they perceive to be the fully-rational forecast of the fundamental rate.  That is, if we denote the fully-rational forecast of next quarter's inflation rate as $E_{t}[\pi_{t+1}]$, people who are updating their forecasts in quarter $t$ set\begin{eqnarray}	F_{t}[\pi_{t,t+1}] & = & E_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}].\end{eqnarray}This assumption can be justified by noting that newspaper articles on inflation almost invariably incorporate interviews with economists who are experts on forecasting the inflation rate.  While the news event that triggers the article is likely to have been the release of the latest inflation statistics, the job of a good journalist is to provide perspective and to extract the meaning of those statistics, which is done largely through interviews with experts.  Furthermore, an examination ofa sample of these articles indicates that the most common form of forecast is for the inflation rate over the next year; it is rare for expert forecasts of any particular future quarter to appear.  It is not implausible, therefore, to suppose that at least part of what readers take away from such stories is a sense of what to expect for the average inflation rate over the next year, which (under people's views of the inflation process) should be the same as the inflation forecast for the next quarter.people's belief in a unit root in the inflation process implies that\begin{eqnarray}	F_{t}[\pi_{t+2}] & = & F_{t}[\pi_{t+1}] \\  F_{t}[\pi_{t+3}] & = & F_{t}[\pi_{t+2}] = F_{t}[\pi_{t+1}]	\end{eqnarray}and so on.% Consider putting in the fact that the SPF forecast of the quarterly% inflation rate has a mean absolute change of 0.3 from tp1 to tp4,% and 0.2 from tp2 to tp4.  This shows that a constant F is not% implausibleAt this point it will be useful to introduce some simplifying notation.  Denote the inflation rate (expressed at an annual rate) between period $t$ and period $t+n$ as $\pi_{t,t+n}$.  Thus what we have previously written as $\pi_{t+1}$ becomes $4 \pi_{t,t+1}$, where the 4 is required to convert the quarterly rate to an annual rate and the subscripts indicate that inflation is measured as the change in the log price level between period $t$ and $t+1$.  Using this notation, \eqref{eq:with4} can be rewritten:\begin{eqnarray}	M_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}] & = & \lambda E_{t}[\pi_{t,t+1}]+(1-\lambda) M_{t-1}[\pi_{t-1,t+3}] . \label{eq:esteqn}\end{eqnarray}because the quarterly data we have used for the Michigan inflation forecast and the SPF forecast do not map very well into our model.This would suggest that if month $t$ is an SPF survey month news reports from that monthIf we suppose that news reports on inflation continue to reflect fresh contacts between reporters and the participants in the SPF between SPF reporting intervals, then the evolution of news media reports will depend on how often the typical forecaster updates his forecast.  The simplest case would be if all forecasters' inflation forecasts were adjusted only once per quarter, just prior to the collection of the SPF data.  In this case we could expect newspaper reports to reflect the latest SPF forecast all the way up to the point where the new SPF forecast is collected.  I have been unable to find systematic information about how often most forecasters' forecasts are updated.  The one forecaster whose methods are a matter of public record is the Federal Reserve, whose entire macroeconomic forecast is updated roughly once every six weeks (to coincide with the monetary policy meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee).  If other forecasters were on a similar schedule we would expect a given SPF forecast to provide an accurate picture of actual forecasts only for about 1-1/2 quarters.To discuss this question clearly we need to introduce a notational convention about the monthly value to be assumed for the SPF forecast in months for which no SPF forecast is collected.  Define an operator $S_{t}[\pi_{t,t+12}]$ which returns the value of the SPF forecastIf we denote the SPF forecast collected in month $t$ as $S_{t}[\pi_{t,t+12}]$.then this assumption would imply that the newspaper reports would be captured by\begin{eqnarray}    N_{t+1}[\pi_{t+1,t+13}] & = & S_{t}[\pi_{t,t+12}]\\  N_{t+2}[\pi_{t+2,t+14}] & = & S_{t}[\pi_{t,t+12}]\\  N_{t+3}[\pi_{t+3,t+15}] & = & S_{t}[\pi_{t,t+12}]\end{eqnarray}where the timing is dictated by the fact that the SPF data are not published until near end of the month so that it only becomes possible for them to be published in news reports beginning in the next month.  The second and third equations indicate same SPF forecast continues to be published until a new forecast is available.To discuss this question clearly we need to introduce a notational convention about the monthly value to be assumed for the SPF forecast in months for which no SPF forecast is collected.

The first is that real journalists like to quote individual forecasters rather than reprint results of a publicly available survey; it seems plausible, therefore, that the news reports about inflation that are printed between the middle and the end of a month in which the survey is taken will on average reflect the forecasts made by the survey participants in that month, because the journalists are probably contacting roughly the same people as were contacted by the SPF. Since most inflation articles are published shortly after release of the month's inflation data and the articles often reflect interviews asking forecasters how the latest data affect their inflation outlook, it seems likely that most of the inflation articles published in a survey month will actually incorporate the information that is subsequently published in the SPF. This would imply that if month $t$ is a survey month,\begin{eqnarray}    N_{t}[\pi_{t,t+12}] & = & S_{t}[\pi_{t,t+12}]\\  N_{t+1}[\pi_{t+1,t+13}] & = & S_{t}[\pi_{t,t+12}]\\  N_{t+2}[\pi_{t+2,t+14}] & = & S_{t}[\pi_{t,t+12}]\end{eqnarray}The assumption that news reports keep repeating the last SPF forecast until a new one is collected is also questionable.  If forecasters update their forecasts more frequently than the SPF data are collected, newspaper reports on inflation are likely to reflect this new information in the period before the next SPF forecast is conducted.  However, in the absence of survey data in the intervening months, little can be done about this problem except to note that it may introduce some specification error that makes fit of the equation deteriorate.Furthermore, while there is typically only a single rational expectations solution to a macro model, dropping any element of the rational expectations framework often leads to a model with many possible equilibria which are difficult to choose among.Furthermore, it seems likely that a rigorous model of calculation-cost-minimization would lead to a periodic (`time dependent') solution rather than probabilistic updating.If month $t$ happened to be a month in which a SPF survey was conducted, it seems likely that No similar equation would apply for month $t+2$ or $t+3$ because theSPF forecast is collected only every third month.  Even if peopleConsider first the SPF forecasts.  On the other hand, mAssuming that the professional forecasters whom the journalists interview for their stories are able to process the new inflation data quickly, it seems likely that the news stories on inflation in mid-month will reflect mostly the same forecasts that are later reported in the SPF.However, by the time month $t+2$ ends the SPF forecast is more than two and a half months out of date.  There will have been two new statistical reports about both inflation and unemployment, income, retail sales, and capacity utilization that have arrived.  Assuming that news reports through the end of month $t+2$ continue to reflect the same forecast that was collected in the middle of month $t$ seems inappropriate.  The situation is even worse for the first half of month $t+3$, because there will have been three reports on unemployment, income, and retail sales since the last SPF forecasts were collected.  The safest course would seem to be to estimate\eqref{eq:monthlym3} only on data from months that were the finalmonth in a quarter, where the model can most realistically be saidto apply.One way to investigate this is through a simulation analysis in whichthe process for $N_{t}$ is taken to be the actual time path of SPFforecasts, and we assume that $\lambda_{1}= 0.15$ while $\lambda_{2} =0.35$, yielding an {\it average} absorption rate of 0.25.  Results ofestimating~\eqref{eq:base} on this population are presented inTable~\ref{table:estonsim}.  Fortunately, the point estimate is quiteclose to 0.25, which suggests that when there is heterogeneity in$\lambda$, estimation of our baseline model will return a $\lambda$that is close to the mean $\lambda$ in the population.The final row of the table presents results from an intermediate case where the $\lambda$'s are heterogeneous within a restricted range from $\lambda = 0.2$ to $\lambda = 0.3$.  Again the estimate of $\lambda$ is very close to its population mean, but the Durbin-Watson statistic indicates that correlation consequences of $\lambda$ heterogeneity are much more modest.Inflation expectations were chosen as the primary modeling target for two reasons.  First, standard theories of inflation imply that workers' inflation expectations can importantly influence inflation outcomes: Workers who expect higher inflation should push for greater wage increases, pushing up employers' costs and therefore prices.  Second, inflation expectations are one of the few macroeconomic variables for which a long time series exists on the expectations of the typical household.  The expectations data come from the University of Michigan's monthly Survey of Consumers, which is also the source for the closely-watched consumer sentiment index.  The baseline version of the model generates a simple analytical expression for the evolution of expectations that can be estimated using the published Michigan data.  The model turns out to do a remarkably good job in explaining these data, yielding an estimate that at any given time only about a quarter of households have fully up-to-date inflation expectations.If not, the most fruitful direction to explore next would probably be whether the literature on `small world' social networks could be applied to the problem.  (The small world literature examines the patterns of connection and transmission of information among members of social networks that exhibit both local (neighborhood) and global connections.  See Watts~\cite{watts:smallworld} for an excellent overview.)The primary conclusion is that the baseline equation for the model without social communication does a very good job in capturing the aggregate dynamics of inflation expectations even when social communication exists.  However, the estimate of the speed-of-transmission parameter $\lambda$ is biased upward, because news now spreads faster through the population than in the baseline model.Intutitively it might seem that if almost 70 percent of agents have inflation expectations that are of a vintage of a year or less, the behavior of the macroeconomy could not be all that different from what would be expected if all expectations were completely up-to-date.  The surprising message of Roberts~\cite{roberts:stickyinfl,roberts:phillips} and Mankiw and Reis~\cite{mankiw&reis:slumps,mankiw&reis:stickye} is that this intuition is wrong.  Mankiw and Reis show that an economy with $\lambda=0.25$ behaves in ways that are sharply different from an economy with fully rational expectations ($\lambda=1$), and argue that in each case where behavior is different the behavior of the $\lambda=0.25$ economy corresponds better with empirical evidence (for example with respect to the effect of interest rate shocks on aggregate output).Mankiw and Reis~\cite{mankiw&reis:slumps,mankiw&reis:stickye} simply postulated $\lambda=0.25$.  Typical rational expectations models assume that all economic actors have full access to all macroeconomic data, agree upon the correct macroeconomic model, and use that model to update their expectations instantly when new macro statistics are released.  More recently, critics have argued that variousfeatures of macroeconomic data are inconsistent with rationalexpectations (in particular, the high persistence of inflation (Fuhrerand Moore~\cite{fuhrer&moore:persistence}) and the apparentinexorability of the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment) areinconsistent with rational expectations (Ball~\cite{ball:sacrifice};Mankiw~\cite{mankiw:inexorable}).  The literature has begun to respondby taking up Friedman's challenge to explicitly model how agentsformulate expectations; Sargent~\cite{sargent:bounded}, for example,explores models in which agents learn by performing regressions onavailable macroeconomic data, while Evans andHonkapohja~\cite{evans&honk:book} survey a variety of alternativemodels of macroeconomic learning.As a recent survey by McCallum~\cite{mccallum:review} notes,alternative models of expectations are generally tested by examiningwhether they produce more plausible macroeconomic dynamics thanstandard rational expectations models.
