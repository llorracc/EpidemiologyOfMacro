This paper proposes a new approach, based on epidemiological models, in which only a small set of agents (professional forecasters) formulate their own expectations, which then spread through the population via the news media in a manner analogous to the spread of a disease.  The paper shows that the very simplest epidemiological model, called the `common source' model, does a good job of explaining the dynamics of inflation and unemployment expectations, and more complicated epidemiological models produce dynamics similar to those that emerge from the common source model.\medskip \medskip {\bf Keywords}: inflation, expectations, unemployment,monetary policy, agent-based modeling\medskip\medskip{\bf JEL Classification Codes: D84, E31} \medskip\medskipThis paper was written in connection with the conference ``The Economy As an Evolving Complex System III'' at the Santa Fe Institute in November of 2001, in honor of Kenneth Arrow's contributions to the Santa Fe Institute and to economics.

This approach makes a set of assumptionsthat are much stronger than rationality alone.  In particular, theframework assumes that all agents in the economy are not merelyrational, but also share identical (correct) beliefs about thestructure of the economy, and have instantaneous and costless accessto all the latest economic data.  Each agent combines these data withthe true macroeconomic model to obtain a forecast for the future pathof the economy, on the assumption that all other agents have identicalbeliefs and information (and therefore forecasts).This set of assumptions has turned out to be a powerful vehicle formacroeconomic modeling, but has never been free from the criticismthat it does not resemble the real world of conflicting opinions andforecasts, workers (and even some business leaders) who may not paymuch attention to macroeconomic matters, and information that cansometimes be costly to obtain and process.  Rational expectationsmodels also have problems explaining some robust stylized facts, suchas the apparent inexorability of the tradeoff between inflation andunemployment rate (see Ball~\cite{ball:sacrifice} orMankiw~\cite{mankiw:inexorable}).  Partly in response to theseproblems, an emerging literature has been exploring models based on anassumption that agents engage in some form of data-based learningprocess to form their expectations; for surveys, seeSargent~\cite{sargent:bounded} or Evans andHonkapohja~\cite{evans&honk:book}.  But the rational expectationsframework remains the dominant approach, partly because it tends to bemathematically more tractable than many proposed alternatives.This paper proposes a tractable alternative framework for the formation of a typical person's expectations.  Rather than having their own macroeconomic model and constantly feeding it the latest statistics, typical people are assumed to obtain their views about the future path of the economy from the news media, directly or indirectly.  Furthermore (and importantly), not every person pays close attention to all macroeconomic news; instead, people are assumed to absorb the economic content of news reports probabilistically, in away that resembles the spread of disease in a population, so that it may take quite some time for news of changed macroeconomic circumstances to penetrate to all agents in the economy.  Roberts~\cite{roberts:inflexp} and Mankiw andReis~\cite{mankiw&reis:slumps,mankiw&reis:stickye} have recentlyproposed aggregate expectations equations that are mathematically verysimilar to aggregate implications of the baseline epidemiologicalmodel of expectations proposed derived here.  Roberts's work wasmotivated by his separate findings inRoberts~\cite{roberts:phillips,roberts:stickyinfl} that empiricalmacro models perform better in a variety of dimensions whensurvey-based inflation expectations are used in place of constructedmodel-consistent rational expectations.  Mankiw andReis~\cite{mankiw&reis:slumps,mankiw&reis:stickye} obtain similarfindings, and particularly emphasize the point that these models canexplain the inexorability of an inflation-unemployment tradeoff muchbetter than the standard model with rational expectations does.However, neither Roberts~\cite{roberts:inflexp} nor Mankiw andReis~\cite{mankiw&reis:slumps,mankiw&reis:stickye} devote much effortto explaining {\it why} the dynamics of aggregate expectations shouldevolve as they proposed (though Roberts does suggest that his equationmight result from the diffusion of press reports).  Mankiw and Reismotivate their model by suggesting that there are costs either ofobtaining or of processing inflation every time an agent updates;however, they do not provide an explicit information-costs orprocessing-costs microfoundation.This paper provides an explicit microfoundation for a simple aggregateexpectations equation, based on simple models of the spread ofdisease.  Rather than tracking the spread of a disease through apopulation, the model tracks the spread of a piece of information(specifically, the latest rational forecast of inflation).A companion paper, Carroll~\cite{carroll:epidemicinflQJE}, estimates the baseline model and finds that it does a good job at capturing the dynamics of household survey expectations about both inflation and unemployment.  Furthermore, that paper shows that household inflation expectations are closer to the expectations of professional forecasters during periods when there is more news coverage of inflation, and that the speed with which household expectations adjust to professional expectations is faster when there is more news coverage.After providing the epidemiological foundation for the model estimatedin Carroll~\cite{carroll:epidemicinflQJE} and summarizing the basicempirical results from that paper, this paper explores theimplications of several extensions to the model, using the kinds of`agent-based' simulation techniques pioneered at the Santa FeInstitute and at the Center for Social and Economic Dynamics (CSED) atthe Brookings Institution.The first extension is to allow heterogeneity in the extent to which different households pay attention to macroeconomic news.  This version of the model is capable of generating demographic differences in macroeconomic expectations like those documented in Souleles~\cite{souleles:sentiment}, which are very hard to rationalize in a rational expectations model.  Both this extension and the baseline version of the model are then simulated in order to derive implications for the standard deviation of inflation expectations across agents.  When the simulated data are compared to the empirical data, the results are mixed.  On one hand, the patterns over time of the empirical and the simulated standard deviations bear a strong resemblance, rising sharply in the late 1970s and early 1980s and then gradually falling off again.  On the other hand, the {\it level} of the standard deviation in the empirical data is much higher than in the simulated data; however, I show that adding simple forms of memory error can make the model and the data match up reasonably well.The next extension examines what happens when the model is generalized to a more standard epidemiological context: A `random mixing' framework in which people can be `infected' with updated inflation expectations by conversations with random other individuals in the population.  It turns out that when the baseline framework that assumes infection only from news sources is estimated on simulated data from the random mixing model, the baseline framework does an excellent job of capturing the dynamics of mean inflation expectations; this suggests that the `common source' simplification is probably not too problematic.The final extension is to a context in which people communicate only with near `neighbors' in some social sense, rather than with random other individuals in the population.  Simulation and estimation of the baseline model on this population finds that the baseline model again does a good job of capturing expectational dynamics; however, in one particular respect the results in this framework are a better match for the empirical results than is the baseline model.The paper concludes with some general lessons and ideas for future research.\section{The Epidemiology of Expectations}% Brief treatment of classical disease in well-mixed population\subsection{The SIR Model}Epidemiologists have developed a rich set of models for the transmission of disease in a population.  The general framework consists of a set of assumptions about who is susceptible to the disease, who among the susceptible becomes infected, and whether and how individuals recover from the infection (leading to the framework's designation as the `SIR' model).The standard assumption is that a susceptible individual who is exposed to the disease in a given period has a fixed probability $p$ of catching the disease.  Designating the set of newly infected individuals in period $t$ as $N_{t}$ and the set of susceptible individuals as $S_{t}$,\begin{eqnarray}        N_{t} & = & p S_{t}.\end{eqnarray}The next step is to determine susceptibility.  The usual assumption is that in order to be susceptible, a healthy individual must have contact with an already-infected person.  In a population where each individual has an equal probability of encountering any other person in the population (a `well-mixed' population), the growth rate of the disease will depend upon the fraction of the population already infected; if very few individuals are currently infected, the small population of diseased people can infect only a small absolute number of new victims.However, there is a special case that is even simpler.  This occurs when the disease is not spread person-to-person, but through contact with a `common source' of infection.  The classic example is Legionnaire's disease, which was transmitted to a group of hotel guests via a contaminated air conditioning system (see Fraser et.  al.~\cite{medline:legionnaires} for a description from the epidemiological literature).  Another application is to illness caused by common exposure to an environmental factor such as air pollution.  In these cases, the transmission model is extremely simple: Any healthy individual is simply assumed to have a constant probability per period of becoming infected from the common source.  This is the case we will examine, since below we will assume that news reports represent a `common source' of information available to all members of the population.One further assumption is needed to complete the model: The probability that someone who is infected will recover from the disease.  The simplest possible assumption (which we will use) is that infected individuals never recover.Under this set of assumptions, the dynamics of the disease are as follows.  In the first period, proportion $p$ of the population catches the disease, leaving $(1-p)$ uninfected.  In period 2, proportion $p$ of these people catch the disease, leading to a new infection rate of $p(1-p)$ and to a fraction $p+p(1-p)$ of the population being infected.  Spinning this process out, it is easy to see that starting from period 0 at the beginning of which nobody is infected, the total proportion infected at the end of $t$ periods is\begin{eqnarray}        \mbox{Fraction Ill} & = & p+p(1-p)+p(1-p)^{2} \ldots + p(1-p)^{t} \label{eq:diseasep} \\         & = & p \sum_{s=0}^{t} (1-p)^{s} \end{eqnarray}whose limit as $t \rightarrow \infty$ is $p/p=1$, implying that (since there is no recovery) everyone will eventually become infected.  In the case where `infection' is interpreted as reflecting an agent's knowledge of a piece of information, this simply says that eventually everyone in the economy will learn a given piece of news.\subsection{The Epidemiology of Inflation Expectations}Now consider a world where most people form their expectations aboutfuture inflation by reading newspaper articles.  Imagine for themoment that every newspaper inflation article contains a completeforecast of the inflation rate for all future quarters, and suppose(again momentarily) that any person who reads such an article cansubsequently recall the entire forecast.  Finally, suppose that at anypoint in time $t$ all newspaper articles print identicalforecasts.\footnote{This subsection is largely drawn fromCarroll~\cite{carroll:epidemicinflQJE}; however, that paper does notdiscuss the epidemiological interpretation of the derivations, as thisderivation does.}Assume that not everybody reads every newspaper article on inflation.  Instead, reading an article on inflation is like becoming infected with a common-source disease: In any given period each individual faces a constant probability $\lambda$ of becoming `infected' with the latest forecast by reading an article.  Individuals who do not encounter an inflation article simply continue to believe the last forecast they read about.\footnote{This is mathematically very similar to the Calvo~\cite{calvoPrices} model in which firms change their prices with probability $p$.}Call $\pi_{t+1}$ the inflation rate between quarter $t$ and quarter $t+1$,\begin{eqnarray}        \pi_{t+1} & = & \log(p_{t+1})-\log(p_{t}),\end{eqnarray}where $p_{t}$ is the aggregate price index in period $t$.  If we define $M_{t}$ as the operator that yields the population-mean value of inflation expectations at time $t$ and denote the {\bf N}ewspaper forecast printed in quarter $t$ for inflation in quarter $s \geq t$ as $N_{t}[\pi_{s}]$, by analogy with equation~\eqref{eq:diseasep} we have that\begin{eqnarray}        M_{t}[\pi_{t+1}] & = & \lambda N_{t}[\pi_{t+1}]        +(1-\lambda) \left\{ \lambda N_{t-1}[\pi_{t+1}]        +(1-\lambda)\left(\lambda N_{t-2}[\pi_{t+1}]         + \ldots\right) \right\} \nonumber \\ \label{eq:stickyerat}\end{eqnarray}The derivation of this equation is as follows.  In period $t$ a fraction $\lambda$ of the population will have been `infected' with the current-period newspaper forecast of the inflation rate next quarter, $N_{t}[\pi_{t+1}]$.  Fraction $(1-\lambda)$ of the population retains the views that they held in period $t-1$ of period $t+1$'s inflation rate.  Those period-$t-1$ views in turn can be decomposed into a fraction $\lambda$ of people who encountered an article in period $t-1$ and obtained the newspaper forecast of period $t+1$'s forecast, $N_{t-1}[\pi_{t+1}]$, and a fraction $(1-\lambda)$ who retained their period-$t-2$ views about the inflation forecast in period $t+1$.  Recursion leads to the remainder of the equation.This expression for inflation expectations is identical to the oneproposed by Mankiw andReis~\cite{mankiw&reis:slumps,mankiw&reis:stickye}, except that intheir model the updating agents construct their own rational forecastof the future course of the macroeconomy rather than learning aboutthe experts' forecast from the news media.  The equation is alsosimilar to a formulation estimated byRoberts~\cite{roberts:stickyinfl}, except that Roberts uses pastrealizations of the inflation rate on the right hand side rather thanpast forecasts.Mankiw and Reis loosely motivate the equation by arguing thatdeveloping a full-blown inflation forecast is a costly activity, whichpeople might therefore engage in only occasionally.  It is undoubtedlytrue that developing a reasonably rational quarter-by-quarter forecastof the inflation rate arbitrarily far into the future would be a verycostly enterprise for a typical person.  If this were really whatpeople were doing, one might expect them to make forecasts only veryrarely indeed.  However, reading a newspaper article about inflation,or hearing a news story on television or the radio, is not costly ineither time or money.  There is no reason to suppose that people needto make forecasts themselves if news reports provide such forecastsessentially for free.  Thus the epidemiological derivation of thisequation seems considerably more attractive than the loosecalculation-costs motivation provided by Mankiw and Reis, both becausethis is a fully specified model and because it delivers furthertestable implications (for example, if there is empirical evidencethat people with higher levels of education are more likely to payattention to news, the model implies that their inflation forecastswill on average be closer to the rational forecast; see below for morediscussion of possible variation in $\lambda$ across populationgroups).Of course, real newspaper articles do not contain a quarter-by-quarter forecast of the inflation rate into the infinite future as assumed in the derivation of \eqref{eq:stickyerat}, and even if they did it is very unlikely that a typical person would be able to remember the detailed pattern of inflation rates far into the future.  In orderto relax these unrealistic assumptions it turns out to be necessary to impose some structure on households' implicit views about theinflation process.Suppose people believe that at any given time the economy has an underlying ``fundamental'' inflation rate.  Furthermore, suppose people believe that future changes in the fundamental rate are unforecastable; that is, after the next period the fundamental rate follows a random walk.  Finally, suppose the person believes that the actual inflation rate in a given quarter is equal to that period's fundamental rate plus an error term $\epsilon_{t}$ which reflects unforecastable transitory inflation shocks (reflected in the `special factors' that newspaper inflation stories often emphasize).  Thus, the person believes that the inflation process is captured by\begin{eqnarray}        \pi_{t} & = & \pi_{t}^{f}+\epsilon_{t}            \label{eq:Fpi} \\   \pi_{t+1}^{f} & = & \pi_{t}^{f}+\eta_{t+1}  \label{eq:Fpi2},%\\   \pi_{t+2}^{f} & = & \pi_{t+1}^{f}+\eta_{t+2}  \label{eq:Fpi3}\\ \phantom{456}\vdots\phantom{3} & & \phantom{\ldots .}\vdots\phantom{\ldots} \nonumber\end{eqnarray}where $\epsilon_{t}$ is a transitory shock to the inflation rate in period $t$ while $\eta_{t}$ is the permanent innovation in the fundamental inflation rate in period $t$.  We further assume that consumers believe that values of $\eta$ beyond period $t+1$, and values of $\epsilon$ beyond period $t$, are unforecastable white noise variables; that is, future changes in the fundamental inflation rate are unforecastable, and transitory shocks are expected to go away.\footnote{Note that we are allowing people to have some idea about how next quarter's fundamental rate may differ from the current quarter's rate, because we did not impose that consumers' expectations of $\eta_{t+1}$ must equal zero.}Before proceeding it is worth considering whether this is a plausible view of the inflation process; we would not want to build a model on an assumption that people believe something patently absurd.  Certainly, it would not be plausible to suppose that people always and everywhere believe that the inflation rate is characterized by~\eqref{eq:Fpi}-\eqref{eq:Fpi2}; for example, Ball~\cite{ball:nearrational} shows that in the US from 1879-1914 the inflation rate was not persistent in the US, while in other countries there have been episodes of hyperinflation (and rapid disinflation) in which views like~\eqref{eq:Fpi}-\eqref{eq:Fpi2} would have been nonsense.However, the relevant question for the purposes of this paper is whether this view of the inflation process is plausible for the period for which I have inflation expectations data.  Perhaps the best way to examine this is to ask whether the univariate statistical process for the inflation rate implied by \eqref{eq:Fpi} and \eqref{eq:Fpi2} is strongly at odds with the actual univariate inflation process.  In other words, after allowing for transitory shocks, does the inflation rate approximately follow a random walk?\input DataAndPrograms/Volumes/Data/ADFpi.texThe appropriate statistical test is an augmented Dickey-Fuller test.  Table~\ref{table:ADFpi} presents the results from such a test.  The second row shows that even with more than 160 quarters of data it is not possible to reject at a 5 percent significance level the proposition that the core inflation rate follows a random walk with a one-period transitory component - that is, it is not possible to reject the process defined by~\eqref{eq:Fpi}-\eqref{eq:Fpi2}.\footnote{The near-unit-root feature of the inflation rate in the post-1959 period is well known to inflation researchers; some authors find that a unit root can be rejected for some measures of inflation over some time periods, but it seems fair to say that the conventional wisdom is that at least since the late 1950s inflation is `close' to a unit root process.  See Barsky~\cite{barsky:fisher} for a more complete analysis, or Ball~\cite{ball:nearrational} for a more recent treatment.} When the transitory shock is allowed to have effects that last for two quarters rather than one, it is not possible to reject a random walk in the fundamental component even at the 10 percent level of significance (the last row in the table).Note that the unit root (or near unit root) in inflation does not imply that future inflation rates are totally unpredictable, only that the history of inflation by itself is not very useful in forecasting future inflation {\it changes} (beyond the disappearance of the transitory component of the current period's shock).  This does not exclude the possibility that current and lagged values of other variables might have predictive power.  Thus, this view of the inflation rate is not necessarily in conflict with the vast and venerable literature showing that other variables (most notably the unemployment rate) do have considerable predictive power for the inflation rate (see Staiger, Stock, and Watson~\cite{ssw:nairu} for a recent treatment).Suppose now that rather than containing a forecast for the entire quarter-by-quarter future history of the inflation rate, newspaper articles simply contain a forecast of the inflation rate over the next year.  The next step is to figure out how such a one-year forecast for inflation can be integrated into some modified version of equation~\eqref{eq:stickyerat}.  To capture this, we must introduce a bit more notation.  Define $\pi_{s,t}$ as the inflation rate between periods $s$ and $t$, converted to an annual rate.  Thus, for example, in quarterly data we can define the inflation rate for quarter $t+1$ at an annual rate as\begin{eqnarray}        \pi_{t,t+1} & = & 4 (\log p_{t+1} - \log p_{t})\\  & = & 4 \pi_{t+1}   \end{eqnarray}where the factor of four is required to convert the quarterly price change to an annual rate.Under this set of assumptions, Carroll~\cite{carroll:epidemicinflQJE}shows that the process for inflation expectations can be rewrittenas\begin{eqnarray}        M_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}] & = & \lambda N_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}]        +(1-\lambda) M_{t-1}[\pi_{t-1,t+3}]. \label{eq:esteqn}\end{eqnarray}That is, mean measured inflation expectations for the next year shouldbe a weighted average between the current newspaper forecast and lastperiod's mean measured inflation expectations.  This equation istherefore directly estimable, assuming an appropriate proxy fornewspaper expectations can be constructed.\footnote{This equation isbasically the same as equation (5) in Roberts~\cite{roberts:inflexp},except that Roberts proposes that the forecast toward which householdexpectations are moving is the `mathematically rational' forecast (andhe simply proposes the equation without examining the underlying logicthat might produce it).}\subsection{Estimates}Estimating \eqref{eq:esteqn} empirically requires the identification of empirical counterparts for household-level inflation expectations and newspaper inflation forecasts.  Conveniently,the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center has been asking households about their inflation expectations for wellover thirty years.  To be precise, households are first asked\begin{quote}``During the next 12 months, do you think that prices in generalwill go up, or go down, or stay where they are right now?''\end{quote}and then those who say ``go up'' (the vast majority) are asked\begin{quote}``By about what percent do you expect prices to go up, on the average, during the next 12 months?''\end{quote}The Survey Research Center uses the answers to these questions to construct an index of mean inflation expectations, which is an almost exact counterpart to the object required by  the theory.  (For details of index construction, see Curtin~\cite{curtin:inflsurvart}).Measuring the forecasts that people are assumed to encounter in the news media is a thornier problem.  But typical newspaper articles on inflation tend to quote professional forecasters, and so it seems reasonable to use the mean forecast from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) as a proxy for what the news media are reporting.Carroll~\cite{carroll:epidemicinflQJE} estimates equation\eqref{eq:esteqn} using the Michigan survey index for $M_{t}$ and theSPF for $N_{t}$.  Results are reproduced in the upper panel oftable~\ref{table:esteqn} (where $N_{t}$ changes to $S_{t}$ toindicate the use of the SPF).\input DataAndPrograms/Volumes/Data/esteqn_sfi.texThe first line of the table (`Memo:') presents results for the simplest possible model: that the value of the Michigan index of inflation expectations $M_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}]$ is equal to a constant, $\alpha_{0}$.  By definition the $\bar{R}^{2}$ is equal to zero; the standard error of the estimate is 0.88.  The last column is reserved for reporting the results of various tests; for example, the test performed in the `Memo:' equation is for whether the average value of the expectations index is zero, $\alpha_{0} = 0$, which is rejected at a very high level of statistical significance, as indicated by a p-value of zero.Equation 1 in the table reflects the estimation of an equation of the form\begin{eqnarray}        M_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}] & = & \alpha_{1}S_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}]+\alpha_{2}M_{t}[\pi_{t-1,t+3}]+\nu_{t}. \label{eq:firstest}\end{eqnarray} Comparing this to \eqref{eq:esteqn} provides the testable restriction that $\alpha_{2}=1-\alpha_{1}$ or, equivalently,\begin{equation}\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}=1 \label{eq:restriction}.\end{equation}The point estimates in equation 1 of $\alpha_{1}=0.36$ and $\alpha_{2}=0.66$ suggest that the restriction \eqref{eq:restriction} is very close to holding true, and the last column confirms that the proposition is easily accepted by the data (the $p$-value is far above the usual critical level of 0.05 which would signal a rejection).Estimation results when the restriction \eqref{eq:restriction} is imposed in estimation are presented in the next row of the table, yielding our central estimate of the model's main parameter: $\lambda= 0.27$.  This point estimate is remarkably close to the value of $0.25$ assumed by Mankiw and Reis~\cite{mankiw&reis:slumps,mankiw&reis:stickye} in their simulation experiments; unsurprisingly, the test reported in the last column for equation 2 indicates that the proposition $\alpha_{1}=\lambda=0.25$ is easily accepted by the data.  Thus, the model implies that in each quarter, only about one fourth of households have a completely up-to-date forecast of the inflation rate over the coming year.  On the other hand, this estimate also indicates that only about 32 percent ($=(1-0.25)^{4})$ of households have inflation expectations that are more than a year out of date.Intutitively it might seem that if almost 70 percent of agents have inflation expectations that are of a vintage of a year or less, the behavior of the macroeconomy could not be all that different from what would be expected if all expectations were completely up-to-date.  The surprising message of Roberts~\cite{roberts:phillips,roberts:stickyinfl} and Mankiw and Reis~\cite{mankiw&reis:slumps,mankiw&reis:stickye} is that this intuition is wrong.  Mankiw and Reis show that an economy with $\lambda=0.25$ behaves in ways that are sharply different from an economy with fully rational expectations ($\lambda=1$), and argue that in each case where behavior is different the behavior of the $\lambda=0.25$ economy corresponds better with empirical evidence.Equation 3 in the table reports some bad news for the model: When a constant term is permitted in the regression equation, it turns out to be highly statistically significant.  The model \eqref{eq:esteqn} did not imply the presence of a constant term, so this is somewhat disappointing.  On the other hand, despite being statistically significant the constant term does not improve the fit of the equation much: The standard error of the estimate only declines from 0.43 to 0.35.  Furthermore, a version of the model with a constant term cannot be plausibly interpreted as a true `structural' model of the expectations process, since it implies that even if the inflation rate were to go to zero forever, and all forecasters were to begin forecasting zero inflation forever, households would never catch on.  A more plausible interpretation of the positive constant term is that it may reflect some form of misspecification of the model.  Below, I will present simulation results showing that if expectations are transmitted from person to person in addition to through the news media, and an equation of the form of \eqref{eq:esteqn} is estimated on the data generated by the modified model, the regression equation returns a positive and statistically significant constant term; thus, the presence of the constant term can be interpreted as evidence that the simple `common-source' epidemiological model postulated here may be a bit too simple.The bottom panel of the table presents results for estimating anequation for unemployment expectations that is parallel to theestimate for inflation expectations.\footnote{Some data constructionwas necessary to do this, because the Michigan survey does not askpeople directly what their expectations are for the level of theunemployment rate, but instead asks whether they think theunemployment rate will rise or fall over the next year.  SeeCarroll~\cite{carroll:epidemicinflQJE} for details about how theunemployment expectations data are constructed.} Equation 2 of thispanel presents the version of the model that restricts thecoefficients to sum to 1; the point estimate of the fraction ofupdaters is $\lambda = 0.31$, but this estimate is not significantlydifferent from the estimate of $\lambda=0.27$ obtained for inflationexpectations or from the $\lambda=0.25$ postulated by Mankiw andReis~\cite{mankiw&reis:slumps,mankiw&reis:stickye}.  The last equationshows that the unemployment expectations equation does notparticularly want an intercept term, so the model actually fits betterfor unemployment expectations than for inflation expectations.In sum, it seems fair to say that the simple `common-source' epidemiological equation~\eqref{eq:esteqn} does a remarkably good job of capturing much of the predictable behavior of both the inflation and the unemployment expectations indexes.\section{Agent Based Models of Inflation Expectations}One of the most fruitful trends in empirical macroeconomics over thelast fifteen years has been the effort to construct rigorousmicrofoundations for macroeconomic models.  Broadly speaking, the goalis to find empirically sensible models for the behavior of theindividual agents (people, firms, banks), which can then be aggregatedto derive implications about macroeconomic dynamics.  Separately, butin a similar spirit, researchers at the Santa Fe Institute, the CSED,and elsewhere have been exploring `agent-based' models that examinethe complex behavior that can sometimes emerge from the interactionsbetween collections of simple agents.One of the primary attractions of an agent-based or microfoundedapproach to modeling macroeconomic behavior is the prospect of beingable to test a model using large microeconomic datasets.  This is anopportunity that has largely been neglected so far in the area ofexpectations formation; I have found only three existing researchpapers that have examined the raw household-level expectations datafrom the Michigan survey.  Two are by NicholasSouleles~\cite{souleles:finance,souleles:sentiment}.  For presentpurposes, the more interesting of these isSouleles~\cite{souleles:sentiment}, which demonstrates (among otherthings) that there are highly statistically significant differencesacross demographic groups in forecasts of several macroeconomicvariables.  Clearly, in a world where everyone's expectations werepurely rational, there should be no demographic differences in suchexpectations.An agent-based version of the epidemiological model above could in principle account for such demographic differences.  The simplest approach would be to assume that there are differences across demographic groups in the propensity to pay attention to economic news (different $\lambda$'s); it is even conceivable that one could calibrate these differences using existing facts about the demographics of newspaper readership (or CNBC viewership).Without access to the underlying micro data it is difficult to tell whether demographic heterogeneity in $\lambda$ would be enough to explain Souleles's findings about systematic demographic differences in macro expectations.  Even without the raw micro data, however, an agent-based model has considerable utility.  In particular, an agent-based approach permits us to examine the consequences of relaxing some of the model's assumptions to see how robust its predictions are.  Given our hypothesis that Souleles's results on demographic differences in expectations might be due to differences in $\lambda$ across groups, the most important application of the agent-based approach is to determining the consequences of heterogeneity in $\lambda$.\footnote{The final paper I know of that examines the micro data underlying the Michigan inflation expectations index is by Branch~\cite{branch:hetero}, who proposes an interesting model in which individual consumers dynamically choose between competing models for predicting inflation, but are subject to idiosyncratic errors.  He finds evidence that people tend to switch toward whichever model has recently produced the lowest mean squared error in its forecasts.  This interesting approach deserves further study.}\subsection{Heterogeneity in $\lambda$}Consider a model in which there are two categories of people, each of which makes up half the population, but with different newspaper-reading propensities, $\lambda_{1}$ and $\lambda_{2}$.For each group it will be possible to derive an equation like \eqref{eq:esteqn},\begin{eqnarray} M_{i,t}[\pi_{t,t+4}] & = & \lambda_{i} N_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}] + (1-\lambda_{i}) M_{i,t-1}[\pi_{t-1,t+3}].\end{eqnarray}But note that (dropping the $\pi$ arguments for simplicity) aggregate expectations will just be the population-weighted sum of expectations for each group,\begin{eqnarray}   M_{t} & = & (M_{1,t} + M_{2,t})/2\\ & = & \left(\frac{\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2}}{2}\right)N_{t} + ((1-\lambda_{1})M_{1,t-1}+(1-\lambda_{2})M_{2,t-1})/2\end{eqnarray}Replace $M_{1,t-1}$ by $M_{t-1} + (M_{1,t-1}-M_{t-1} )$ and similarly for $M_{2,t-1}$ to obtain\begin{eqnarray} M_{t} & = & \left(\frac{\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2}}{2}\right) N_{t} + \left(1-\left(\frac{\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2}}{2}\right)\right)M_{t-1}+\overbrace{\left(\frac{M_{1,t-1}+M_{2,t-1}}{2}\right)-M_{t-1}}^{=0} \nonumber\\ & & -  \left(\frac{\lambda_{1} (M_{1,t-1}-M_{t-1})+\lambda_{2} (M_{2,t-1}-M_{t-1})}{2}\right)\\ M_{t} & = & \hat{\lambda} N_{t} + (1-\hat{\lambda}) M_{t-1} - \left(\frac{\lambda_{1} (M_{1,t-1}-M_{t-1})+\lambda_{2} (M_{2,t-1}-M_{t-1})}{2}\right) \label{eq:lambda12}\label{eq:heterolam}\end{eqnarray}where $\hat{\lambda} = (\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2})/2$.Thus, the dynamics of aggregate inflation expectations with heterogeneity in $\lambda$ have a component $\hat{\lambda} N_{t}+(1-\hat{\lambda}) M_{t-1}$ that behaves just like a version of the model when everybody has the same $\lambda$ equal to the average value in the population, plus a term (in big parentheses in \eqref{eq:lambda12}) that depends on the joint distribution of $\lambda$'s and the deviation by group of the difference between the previous period's rational forecast and the group's forecast.Now consider estimating the baseline equation\begin{eqnarray}        M_{t} & = & \lambda N_{t}+ (1-\lambda) M_{t-1} \label{eq:base}\end{eqnarray}on a population with heterogeneous $\lambda$'s.  The coefficient estimates will be biased in a way that depends on the correlations of $N_{t}$, $M_{t-1}$ and $M_{t}$ with the last term in equation~\eqref{eq:heterolam}, $\left(\frac{\lambda_{1} (M_{1,t-1}-M_{t-1})+\lambda_{2} (M_{2,t-1}-M_{t-1})}{2}\right)$.  There is no analytical way to determine the magnitude or nature of the bias without making a specific assumption about the time series process for $N_{t}$, and even with such an assumption all that could be obtained is an expected asymptotic bias.  The bias in any particular small sample would depend on the specific history of $N_{t}$ in that sample.The only sensible way to evaluate whether the bias problem is likely to be large given the actual history of inflation and inflation forecasts in the US is to simulate a model with households who have heterogeneous $\lambda$'s and to estimate the baseline equation on aggregate statistics generated by that sample.Specifically, the experiment is as follows.  A population of $P$ agents is created, indexed by $i$; each of them begins by drawing a value of $\lambda_{i}$ from a uniform distribution on the interval $(\underline{\lambda},\overline{\lambda})$.  In an initial period $0$, each agent is endowed with an initial value of $M_{i,0}$ = 2 percent.  Thus the population mean value $M_{0}= (1/P) \sum_{i=1}^{P} M_{i,0} = 2$.  For period $1$, each agent draws a random variable distributed on the interval $[0,1]$.  If that draw is less than or equal to the agent's $\lambda_{i}$, the agent updates $M_{i,1} = N_{1}$ where $N_{1}$ is taken to be the `Newspaper' forecast of the next year's inflation rate in period $t$; if the random draw is less than $\lambda_{i}$ the agent's $M_{i,1} = M_{i,0}$.  The population-average value of $M_{1}$ is calculated, and the simulation then proceeds to the next period.For the simulations, the `news' series $N_{t}$ is chosen as the concatenation of 1) the actual inflation rate from 1960q1 to 1981q2 and 2) the SPF forecast of inflation from 1981q3 to 2001q2.  Then regression equations corresponding to~\eqref{eq:base} are estimated on the subsample corresponding to the empirical subsample, 1981q3 to 2001q2.  Thus, the simulation results should indicate the dynamics of $M_{t}$ that would have been observed if actual newspaper forecasts of inflation had been a random walk until 1981q2 and then had tracked the SPF once the SPF data began to be published.The results of estimating~\eqref{eq:esteqn} on the data generated by this simulation when the population is $P=250,000$ are presented in Table~\ref{table:estonsim}.  For comparison, and to verify that the simulation programs are working properly, equation (1) presents results when all agents' $\lambda$'s are exogenously set to 0.25.  As expected, the simulation returns an estimate of $\lambda = 0.25$, and the equation fits so precisely that there are essentially no residuals.\begin{table}\input DataAndPrograms/Volumes/Data/estonsim.tex\end{table}The remaining rows of the table present the results in the case where $\lambda$ values are heterogeneous in the population.  The second row presents the most extreme example, $[\underline{\lambda},\overline{\lambda}] = [0.00,0.50]$.  Fortunately, even in this case the regression yields an estimate of the speed-of-adjustment parameter $\lambda$ that, at around $0.26$, is still quite close to the true average value $0.25$ in the population.  Interestingly, however, one consequence of the heterogeneity in $\lambda$ is that there is now a very large amount of serial correlation in the residuals of the equation; the Durbin-Watson statistic indicates that this serial correlation is postive and a Q test shows it to be highly statistically significant.Heterogeneous $\lambda$'s induce serial correlation primarily becausethe views of people with $\lambda$'s below $\bar{\lambda}$ are slow tochange.  For example, if the `rational' forecast is highly seriallycorrelated, an agent with a $\lambda$ close to zero will be expectedto make errors of the same size and direction for many periods in arow after a shock to the fundamental inflation rate, until finallyupdating.The comparison of the high serial correlation that emerges from this simulation to the low serial correlation that emerged in the empirical estimation in Table~\ref{table:esteqn} suggests that heterogeneity in $\lambda$ is probably not as great as the assumed uniform distribution between 0.0 and 0.5.  Results are therefore presented for a third experiment, in which $\lambda$'s are uniformly distributed between 0.2 and 0.3.  Estimation on the simulated data from this experiment yields an estimate of $\lambda$ very close to 0.25 and a Durbin-Watson statistic that indicates much less serial correlation than emerged with the broad $[0,0.5]$ range of possible $\lambda$'s.  Finally, the last row presents results when $\lambda$ is uniformly distributed over the interval [0.15,0.35].  This case is intermediate: the estimate of $\lambda$ is still close to 0.25, but the Durbin-Watson statistic now begins to indicate substantial serial correlation.On the whole, the simulation results suggest that the serialcorrelation properties of the empirical data are consistent with amoderate degree of heterogeneity in $\lambda$, but not with extremeheterogeneity.  It is important to point out, however, that empiricaldata contain a degree of measurement and sampling error that is absentin the simulated data.  To the extent that these sources can bethought of as white noise, they should bias the Durbin-Watsonstatistic up in comparison to the `true' Durbin-Watson, so the scopefor heterogeneity in $\lambda$ is probably considerably larger thanwould be indicated by a simple comparison of the measured andsimulated Durbin-Watson statistics.  Furthermore, since the error termis very tiny (the standard errors are less than 4/100 of onepercentage point), so any serial correlation properties it has cannotbe of much econometric consequence.  Thus the serial correlationresults should not be taken as very serious evidence againstsubstantial heterogeneity in $\lambda$.A few last words on serial correlation.  The important point in Mankiwand Reis~\cite{mankiw&reis:slumps,mankiw&reis:stickye}, as well as inwork by Ball~\cite{ball:nearrational} and others, is that the presenceof some people whose expectations are not fully and instantaneouslyforward-looking profoundly changes the behavior of macro models. Thus, the possibility of hetergeneity in $\lambda$, and the resultingserial correlation in errors, has an importance here beyond its usualeconometric ramifications for standard errors and inference.  If thereare some consumers whose expectations are very slow to update, theymay be primarily responsible for important deviations between therational expectations model and macroeconomic reality.\subsection{Matching the Standard Deviation of Inflation Expectations}Thus far all our tests of the model have been based on its predictions for behavior of mean inflation expectations.  Of course, the model also generates predictions for other statistics like the standard deviation of expectations across households at a point in time.  Some households will have expectations that correspond to the most recent inflation forecast, while others will have expectations that are out of date by varying amounts.  One prediction of the model is that (for a constant $\lambda$) if SPF inflation forecasts have remained stable for a long time, the standard deviation of expectations across households should be low, while if there have been substantial recent changes in the rational forecast of inflation we should expect to see more cross-section variability in households' expectations.This is testable.  Curtin~\cite{curtin:inflsurvart} reports average values for the standard deviation for the Michigan survey's inflation expectations over the period from 1978 to 1995; results are plotted as the solid line in figure~\ref{fig:inflstd}.  It is true that the empirical standard deviation was higher in the early 1980s, a time when inflation rates and SPF inflation expectations changed rapidly over the course of a few years, than later when the inflation rate was lower and more stable.\input DataAndPrograms/Volumes/Data/inflstd.tex% This figure is generated in the estonsim (or AgentSocialSim) program%\begin{figure} \centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{DataAndPrograms/Volumes/Data/inflstdsim.eps}}%\epsfbox{DataAndPrograms/Volumes/Data/inflindex.eps}} \caption{Standard Deviation of Inflation Expectations from Michigan Survey} \label{fig:inflstdsim}\end{figure}The short and long dashed loci in the figure depict the predictions of the homogeneous $\lambda=0.25$ and heterogeneous $\lambda \in [0.0,0.5]$ versions of the agent-based model.  There is considerable similarity between the time paths of the actual and simulated standard deviations: The standard deviation is greatest for both simulated and actual data in the late 1970s and early 1980s, because that is the period when the levels of both actual and expected inflation changed the most.  In both simulated and real data the standard deviation falls gradually over time, but shows an uptick around the 1990 recession and recovery before returning to its downward path.However, the {\it levels} of the standard deviations are very different between the simulations and the data; the scale for the Michigan data on the right axis ranges from 4 to 11, while the scale for the simulated standard deviations on the left axis ranges from 0 to 3.  Over the entire sample period, the standard deviation of household inflation expectations is about 6.5 in the real data, compared to only about 0.5 in the simulated data.Curtin~\cite{curtin:inflsurvart} analyzes the sources of the largestandard deviation in inflation expectations across households.  Hefinds that part of the high variability is attributable to smallnumbers of households with very extreme views of inflation.  Curtin'sinterpretation is that these households are probably justill-informed, and he proposes a variety of other ways to extract thedata's central tendency that are intended to be robust to the presenceof these outlying households.  However, even Curtin's preferredmeasure of dispersion in inflation expectations, the size of the rangefrom the 25th to the 75th percentile in expectations, has an averagespan of almost 5 percentage points over the 81q3-95q4 period, muchgreater than would be produced by any of the simulation modelsconsidered above.\footnote{Curtin advocates use of the median ratherthan the mean as the summary statistic for `typical' inflationexpectations.  However, the epidemiological model has simpleanalytical predictions for the mean but not the median of householdexpectations, so the empirical work in this paper uses the mean.}The first observation to make about the excessive cross-sectionvariability of household inflation expectations is that suchvariability calls into question almost all standard models of wagesetting in which well-informed workers demand nominal wage increasesin line with a rational expectation about the future inflationrate.\footnote{The only prominent exception I am aware of is the twopapers by Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry~\cite{adp:one,adp:two} mentionedbriefly above.  In these models workers do not bother to learn aboutthe inflation rate unless it is sufficiently high to make the researchworthwhile.  However such a model would presumably imply a modestupper bound to inflation expectation errors, since people whosuspected the inflation rate was very high would have the incentive tolearn the truth.  In fact, Curtin (1996) finds that the mostproblematic feature of the empirical data is the small number ofhouseholds with wildly implausibly high forecasts.} If a largefraction of workers have views about the future inflation rate thatare a long way from rational, it is hard to believe that those viewshave much impact on the wage-setting process.  Perhaps it is possibleto construct a model in which equilibrium is determined by averageinflation expectations, with individual variations making little or nono difference to individual wages.  Constructing such a model isbeyond the scope of this paper; but whether or not such a model isproposed, it seems likely that any thorough understanding of therelation between inflation expectations in the aggregate and actualinflation will need a model of how individuals' inflation expectationsare determined.The simplest method of generating extra individual variability in expectations is to assume that when people encounter a news report on inflation, the process of committing the associated inflation forecast to memory is error-prone.\footnote{ Alternatively, one could assume that retrieval from memory is error-prone.  The implications are very similar but not identical.}\input DataAndPrograms/Volumes/Data/inflstdlogerr.tex% This figure is generated in the estonsim or AgentSocialSim programTo be specific, suppose that whenever an agent encounters a news report and updates his expectations, the actual expectation stored in memory is given by the expectation printed in the news report times a mean-one lognormally distributed storage error.  Since the errors average out in the population as a whole, this assumption generates dynamics of aggregate inflation expectations that are identical to those of the baseline model.  Figure~\ref{fig:inflstdlogerr} plots the predictions for the standard deviation of inflation expectations across households of the baseline $\lambda=0.25$ model with a lognormally distributed error with a standard error of 0.5.  The figure shows that the change in the standard deviation of inflation residuals over time is very similar in the model and in the data, but the level of the standard deviation is still considerably smaller in the model.  This could of course be rectified by including an additive error in addition to the multiplicative error.  Such a proposed solution could be tested by examining more detailed information on the structure of expectations at the household level like that examined by Souleles~\cite{souleles:sentiment}.\subsection{Social Transmission of Inflation Expectations}As noted above, the standard model of disease transmission is one in which illness is transmitted by person-to-person contact.  Analogously, it is likely that some people's views about inflation are formed by conversations with others rather than by direct contact with news reports.  For the purposes of this paper the most important question is whether the simple formula~\eqref{eq:esteqn} would do a reasonably good job in capturing the dynamics of inflation expectations even when social transmission occurs.Simulation of an agent-based model with both modes of transmission is straightforward.  The extended model works as follows.  In each period, every person has a probability $\lambda$ of obtaining the latest forecast by reading a news story.  Among the $(1-\lambda)$ who do not encounter the news source, the algorithm is as follows.  For each person $i$, there is some probability $p$ that he will have a conversation about inflation with a randomly-selected other person $j$ in the population.  If $j$ has an inflation forecast that is of more recent vintage than $i$'s forecast, then $i$ adopts $j$'s forecast, and vice-versa.\footnote{This rules out the possibility that the less-recent forecast would be adopted by the person with a more-recent information.  The reason to rule this out is that if there were no directional bias (more recent forecasts push out older ones), the swapping of information would not change the distribution of forecasts in the population and therefore would not result in aggregate dynamics any different from those when no social communication is allowed.}\input DataAndPrograms/Volumes/Data/estran.texTable~\ref{table:estran} presents results of estimating equation~\eqref{eq:esteqn} on the aggregate inflation expectations data that result from this agent-based simulation under a uniform fixed $\lambda=0.25$ probability of news-reading.  The first two rows present results when the probability of a social transmission event is $p=0.25$.  The primary effect of social transmission is to bias upward the estimated speed of adjustment term.  The point estimate is about 0.31, or about 6 percentage points too high.  However, the $\bar{R}^2$ of the equation is virtually 100 percent, indicating that even when there is social transmission of information, the common-source model does an excellent job of explaining the dynamics of aggregate expectations.  The next row shows the results when the rate of social transmission is $p=0.10$.  Unsurprisingly, the size of the bias in the estimate of $\lambda$ is substantially smaller in this case, and the model continues to perform well in an $\bar{R}^{2}$ sense.A potential objection to these simulations is that they assume `random mixing.'  That is, every member of the population is equally likely to encounter any other member.  Much of the literature on agent-based models has examined the behavior of populations that are distributed over a landscape in which most interactions occur between adjacent locations on the landscape.  Often models with local but no global interaction yield quite different outcomes from `random mixing' models.To explore a model in which social communication occurs locally but not globally, I constructed a population distributed over a two dimensional lattice, of size 500x500, with one agent at each lattice point.  I assumed that a fraction $\eta$ of agents are `well informed' - that is, as soon as a new inflation forecast is released, these agents learn the new forecast with zero lag.  Other agents in the population obtain their views of inflation solely through interaction with neighbors.\footnote{For the purposes of the simulation, an agent's neighbors are the agents in the eight cells surrounding him.  For agents at the borders of the grid, neighborhoods are assumed to wrap around to the opposite side of the grid; implicitly this assumes the agents live on a torus.} Thus, in this model, news travels out in concentric patterns (one step on the landscape per period) from its geographical origination points (the news agents, who are scattered randomly across the landscape).  As in the random mixing model, I assume that new news drives out old news.\input DataAndPrograms/Volumes/Data/estnbr.texResults from estimating the baseline model on data produced by the `local interactions' simulations are presented in table~\ref{table:estnbr}.  For comparability with the baseline estimate of $\lambda=0.25$ in the common-source model, I have assumed that proportion $\eta=0.25$ of the agents in the new model are the well-informed types whose inflationary expectations are always up to date.  Interestingly, estimating the baseline model yields a coefficient of about $\alpha_{1}=0.22$ on the SPF forecast, even though 25 percent of agents always have expectations exactly equal to the SPF forecast.  The coefficient on lagged expectations gets a value of about 0.71, and the last column indicates that a test of the proposition that $\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}=1$ now rejects strongly.  However, the regression still has an $\bar{R}^{2}$ of around 0.99, so the basic common-source model still does an excellent job of capturing the dynamics of aggregate inflation expectations.The most interesting result, however, is shown in the next row: The estimation now finds a highly statistically significant role for a nonnegligible constant term.  Recall that the only real empirical problem with the common-source model was that the estimation found a statistically significant role for a constant term.Results in the next rows show what happens when the proportion of newsagents is reduced to $\eta = 0.15$.  As expected, the estimate of$\alpha_{1}$ falls; indeed, the downward bias is now even morepronounced than with 25 percent well-informed.  However, when aconstant is allowed into the equation, the constant term itself ishighly significant and the estimate of $\alpha_{1}$ jumps to about0.18, not far from the fraction of always-up-to-date agents in thepopulation.What these simulation results suggest is that the empirical constant term may somehow be reflecting the fact that some transmission of inflation expectations is through social exchange rather than directly through the news media.  Furthermore, and happily, it is clear from the structure of the local interactions model that this population would eventually learn the true correct expectation of inflation if the SPF forecasts permanently settled down to a nonstochastic steady-state.  Thus it is considerably more appealing to argue that the constant term reflects misspecification of the model (by leaving out social interactions) than to accept the presence of a true constant term (and its associated implication of permanent bias).A final caveat is in order.  The central lesson of Mankiw andReis~\cite{mankiw&reis:slumps,mankiw&reis:stickye} and others is thatthe extent to which inflation can be reduced without increasingunemployment depends upon the speed with which a new view of inflationcan be communicated to the {\it entire} population.  It is not at allclear that the predictions about the medium-terminflation/unemployment tradeoff of a model with social transmission ofexpectations, or even of the common-source model with heterogeneous$\lambda$'s, are similar to the predictions of the homogeneous$\lambda$ model examined by Mankiw andReis~\cite{mankiw&reis:slumps,mankiw&reis:stickye}.  Investigatingthis question should be an interesting project for future research.\section{Conclusions}This paper was written to provide a specific example of a more generalproposition: That many of the puzzles confronting standardmacroeconomic models today could be resolved by abandoning themathematically elegant but patently false assumptions of rationalexpectations models and replacing them with more realistic andexplicit models of how people obtain their ideas about economictopics, involving some form of learning or social transmission ofknowledge and information.  While the paper confines itself topresenting results from agent-based simulations of such a model ofinflation expectaitons, the closely related work by Mankiw andReis~\cite{mankiw&reis:slumps,mankiw&reis:stickye} shows thatmacroeconomic dynamics are much more plausible when expectations aregoverned by a model like the ones explored here.Other puzzles that might yield to such an approach are legion.  Forexample, excess smoothness in aggregate consumption (releative to therational expectations benchmark) may reflect precisely the same kindof inattention posited for inflation expectations here (I am activelypursuing this possibility in ongoing work).  A plausible explanationfor the equity premium puzzle might be to suppose that it has taken along time for news of the favorable risk/return tradeoff of stocks tospread from experts like Mehra andPrescott~\cite{mehraPrescottPuzzle} to the general population.  Thestrong systematic relationship of productivity growth and the naturalrate of unemployment documented, for example, by Staiger, Stock, andWatson~\cite{ssw:nairu} and Ball and Moffitt~\cite{ball&moffitt:pty}may reflect workers' imperfect knowledge about productivity growth(and the slow social transmission of such information).  The detaileddynamics of productivity itself can surely be captured better bymodels in which new technologies spread gradually in a population thanby models in which new technologies instantaneously boost productivityupon the date of invention (which is the conventional `technologyshock' approach in rational expectations models).  And a substantialliterature now exists arguing that social transmission of informationin a population of investing agents may be able to explain the excessvolatility of asset prices compared to the rational expectationsbenchmark (see LeBaron~\cite{lebaron:summary} for a summary).\vfill\eject\input /Software/latex/texhtml\pagebreak\vfill\eject\bibliographystyle{/Software/latex/qje}\bibliography{/Software/latex/economics}\end{document}\pagebreak\vfill\eject\input DataAndPrograms/Volumes/Data/ADFpi.tex\input DataAndPrograms/Volumes/Data/piforc.tex\input DataAndPrograms/Volumes/Data/esteqn.tex\input DataAndPrograms/Volumes/Data/erronnews.tex\input DataAndPrograms/Volumes/Data/newslam.tex\input DataAndPrograms/Volumes/Data/esteqn_unemp.tex\input DataAndPrograms/Volumes/Data/estonsim.tex\input DataAndPrograms/Volumes/Data/inflfigs.tex\input DataAndPrograms/Volumes/Data/inflstd.tex\input DataAndPrograms/Volumes/Data/inflstdlogerr.texThe ancient Greek philosopher Xenophanes once observed that if oxen had artistic talent, the gods they would paint would look like oxen instead of like Apollo or Aphrodite.  Xenophanes might not have been surprised to learn that the agents with whom economists populate their models are essentially godlike versions of economists: infinitely knowledgable and infinitely rational and deeply interested in the structure and workings of the economy.  However, in a twist that surely would have surprised even Xenophanes, we assume that these godlike creatures are a good representation of the average person or business manager.\begin{eqnarray}        M_{t}[\pi_{t+1}] & = & \lambda N_{t}[\pi_{t+1}] + (1-\lambda)\lambda E_{t-1}[\pi_{t+1}]+(1-\lambda)^{2} \lambda E_{t-2}[\pi_{t+1}] + \ldots .\end{eqnarray}\begin{eqnarray*}        \pi_{t-4,t} & = & \pi_{t-3}+\pi_{t-2}+\pi_{t-1}+\pi_{t}  \\         & = & F_{t-3}[\pi_{t-3}]+\epsilon_{t-3}+F_{t-2}[\pi_{t-2}]+\epsilon_{t-2}   +F_{t-1}[\pi_{t-1}]+\epsilon_{t-1}+F_{t}[\pi_{t}]+\epsilon_{t}\\   & = & 4 F_{t-3}[\pi_{t-3}] + 3 \eta_{t-2}+2\eta_{t-1}+\eta_{t}+ \epsilon_{t-3}+\epsilon_{t-2}+\epsilon_{t-1}+\epsilon_{t}\end{eqnarray*}and analogously \begin{eqnarray*}        \pi_{t,t+4} & = & 4 F_{t+1}[\pi_{t+1}]  + 3 \eta_{t+2}+2\eta_{t+3}+\eta_{t}+ \epsilon_{t+1}+\epsilon_{t+2}+\epsilon_{t+3}+\epsilon_{t+4}\\ & = & 4 F_{t-3}[\pi_{t-3}]+4(\eta_{t-2}+\eta_{t-1}+\eta_{t}+\eta_{t+1})+ 3 \eta_{t+2}+2\eta_{t+3}+\eta_{t}\\ &   & + \epsilon_{t+1}+\epsilon_{t+2}+\epsilon_{t+3}+\epsilon_{t+4}\end{eqnarray*}Consider how the inflation rateIf inflation is indeed a unit root process with a white noise transitory component, then the inflation rate over the next year will be\begin{eqnarray*}        \pi_{t,t+4} & = & F_{t}[\pi_{t+1}]+\epsilon_{t+1}+F_{t+2}[\pi_{t+2}]+\epsilon_{t+2}+ F_{t+3}[\pi_{t+3}]+\epsilon_{t+3}+F_{t+4}[\pi_{t+4}]+\epsilon_{t+4}   \\       & = & 4 F_{t}[\pi_{t}]+4\eta_{t+1}+3 \eta_{t+2}+2\eta_{t+3}+\eta_{t+1}+\epsilon_{t+1}+\epsilon_{t+2}+\epsilon_{t+3}+\epsilon_{t+4}%\\      & = & F_{t}[\pi_{t-1,t}]+\chi_{t,t+4}\end{eqnarray*}where $E_{t}[\eta_{t+1}]=E_{t}[\eta_{t+2}]=E_{t}[\epsilon_{t+1}]=E_{t}[\epsilon_{t+2}]=\ldots=0$ implies that $\chi_{t,t+4}$ is a white noise error term.  That is, the only element of predictability in future inflation rates comes from the fact that the future fundamental rate is equal to the current fundamental rate plus some white noise innovations.Now consider a regressionof the inflation rate over the next year on the inflation rate for thecurrent quarter:\begin{eqnarray}        \pi_{t,t+4} & = & \alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1} \pi_{t-1,t}\\  F_{t}[\pi_{t-1,t}]+\chi_{t,t+4}             & = & \alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1} (F_{t}[\pi_{t-1,t}]+\epsilon_{t})\\  F_{t}[\pi_{t-1,t}]                  & = & \alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1} (F_{t}[\pi_{t-1,t}]+\epsilon_{t})-\chi_{t,t+4}\end{eqnarray}If the variance of the transitory component of inflation were zero, the regression should  then the only predictable element of the difference between inflation over the next year and inflation in the current quarter would come from the $-4\epsilon_{t}$ term.  Table~\ref{table:survforecast} presents evidence on these questions.  The first two rows show that both the Michigan inflation expectations index and the SPF forecast have highly statistically significant predictive power for the core inflation rate, even when the lagged core inflation rate is included as a regressor; indeed, in neither case is the lagged inflation rate statistically significant, which indicates that both survey measures already incorporate any information contained in the lagged inflation rate.\footnote{The Durbin-Watson and Q statistics indicate that there is a substantial amount of serial correlation in the residuals from these equations, so the standard errors are adjusted using the Newey-West correction with 8 lags and a damping factor of 1.}$^{,}$\footnote{It might seem that this evidence that the Michigan index can forecast the change in the inflation rate contradicts the assumption that people believe inflation follows a random walk.  In fact, however, there is no contradiction.  In our model, people believe that future fundamental inflation rates follow a random walk beginning in period $t+1$.  But their views of the inflation rate for period $t+1$ are not constrained to be a random innovation with respect to the actual inflation rate in period $t$, for two reasons.  First, we assumed that people in period $t$ believe that $F_{t}[\pi_{t+1}]$ is equal to the rational forecast $E_{t}[\pi_{t+1}]$, and there is no restriction on how the rational forecast may differ from the recent level of inflation; in particular, the rational forecast may be influenced, for example, by the level of the unemployment rate.  Second, people in this model know that any transitory inflation shocks in period $t$ will disappear for future periods.} The third row of the table shows that when both survey measures are included in the forecasting equation, the Michigan survey measure has no information about the future inflation rate that is not contained in the SPF forecast, while the SPF forecast has considerable and highly statistically significant predictive power not contained in the Michigan forecast.  The SPF's victory is made more impressive by the fact that the SPF forecast is constructed in the middle of the second month of the quarter, and therefore by construction cannot incorporate any information released during the latter half of the quarter, while the Michigan survey measure for the corresponding quarter includes results from interviews up to the last day of the quarter.  The fact that the SPF contains considerably more forecasting power despite its substantial timing disadvantage bolsters the proposition that the SPF forecast is considerably better than the Michigan forecast.An alternative way to examine the rationality and efficiency of the two forecasts is to ask about the ability of the two surveys to forecast the {\it change} in the inflation rate.  In a statistical sense this can be viewed as a tougher challenge than forecasting the level of the inflation rate; after all, if the inflation rate really has a unit root (which we could not reject above), then the level of the inflation rate would be highly forecastable but changes in the inflation rate (beyond the current quarter) would be totally unforecastable.  The next three panels of the table therefore regress the change in the annual inflation rate between the present and one year in the future on the SPF and Michigan survey's forecasts of that change.  That is, \begin{eqnarray*}        \pi_{t-4,t} & = & \pi_{t-3}+\pi_{t-2}+\pi_{t-1}+\pi_{t}  \\         & = & F_{t-3}[\pi_{t-3}]+F_{t-2}[\pi_{t-2}]+F_{t-1}[\pi_{t-1}]+F_{t}[\pi_{t}]  \\         &  & + \epsilon_{t-3}+\epsilon_{t-2}+\epsilon_{t-1}+\epsilon_{t}\end{eqnarray*}\begin{eqnarray*}        F_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}] & = & 4 F_{t}[\pi_{t+1}]\end{eqnarray*}Comparing these two expressions, it is evident that there are severalAgain, both surveys contain highly statistically significant information, but again the SPF forecast is substantially better than the Michigan forecast.\footnote{In principle, such predictability could reflect either time aggregation problems or the modest predictability that comes from knowing that the current transitory components of inflation will disappear.  The }Now we can integrate the fact that experts have some ability to predict the future inflation rate with the person's view that the inflation process has a unit root by supposing that when people update their views about the fundamental inflation rate they update to what they perceive to be the fully-rational forecast of the fundamental rate.  That is, if we denote the fully-rational forecast of next quarter's inflation rate as $E_{t}[\pi_{t+1}]$, people who are updating their forecasts in quarter $t$ set\begin{eqnarray}        F_{t}[\pi_{t,t+1}] & = & E_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}].\end{eqnarray}This assumption can be justified by noting that newspaper articles on inflation almost invariably incorporate interviews with economists who are experts on forecasting the inflation rate.  While the news event that triggers the article is likely to have been the release of the latest inflation statistics, the job of a good journalist is to provide perspective and to extract the meaning of those statistics, which is done largely through interviews with experts.  Furthermore, an examination ofa sample of these articles indicates that the most common form of forecast is for the inflation rate over the next year; it is rare for expert forecasts of any particular future quarter to appear.  It is not implausible, therefore, to suppose that at least part of what readers take away from such stories is a sense of what to expect for the average inflation rate over the next year, which (under people's views of the inflation process) should be the same as the inflation forecast for the next quarter.people's belief in a unit root in the inflation process implies that\begin{eqnarray}        F_{t}[\pi_{t+2}] & = & F_{t}[\pi_{t+1}] \\  F_{t}[\pi_{t+3}] & = & F_{t}[\pi_{t+2}] = F_{t}[\pi_{t+1}]  \end{eqnarray}and so on.% Consider putting in the fact that the SPF forecast of the quarterly% inflation rate has a mean absolute change of 0.3 from tp1 to tp4,% and 0.2 from tp2 to tp4.  This shows that a constant F is not% implausibleAt this point it will be useful to introduce some simplifying notation.  Denote the inflation rate (expressed at an annual rate) between period $t$ and period $t+n$ as $\pi_{t,t+n}$.  Thus what we have previously written as $\pi_{t+1}$ becomes $4 \pi_{t,t+1}$, where the 4 is required to convert the quarterly rate to an annual rate and the subscripts indicate that inflation is measured as the change in the log price level between period $t$ and $t+1$.  Using this notation, \eqref{eq:with4} can be rewritten:\begin{eqnarray}        M_{t}[\pi_{t,t+4}] & = & \lambda E_{t}[\pi_{t,t+1}]+(1-\lambda) M_{t-1}[\pi_{t-1,t+3}] . \label{eq:esteqn}\end{eqnarray}because the quarterly data we have used for the Michigan inflation forecast and the SPF forecast do not map very well into our model.This would suggest that if month $t$ is an SPF survey month news reports from that monthIf we suppose that news reports on inflation continue to reflect fresh contacts between reporters and the participants in the SPF between SPF reporting intervals, then the evolution of news media reports will depend on how often the typical forecaster updates his forecast.  The simplest case would be if all forecasters' inflation forecasts were adjusted only once per quarter, just prior to the collection of the SPF data.  In this case we could expect newspaper reports to reflect the latest SPF forecast all the way up to the point where the new SPF forecast is collected.  I have been unable to find systematic information about how often most forecasters' forecasts are updated.  The one forecaster whose methods are a matter of public record is the Federal Reserve, whose entire macroeconomic forecast is updated roughly once every six weeks (to coincide with the monetary policy meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee).  If other forecasters were on a similar schedule we would expect a given SPF forecast to provide an accurate picture of actual forecasts only for about 1-1/2 quarters.To discuss this question clearly we need to introduce a notational convention about the monthly value to be assumed for the SPF forecast in months for which no SPF forecast is collected.  Define an operator $S_{t}[\pi_{t,t+12}]$ which returns the value of the SPF forecastIf we denote the SPF forecast collected in month $t$ as $S_{t}[\pi_{t,t+12}]$.then this assumption would imply that the newspaper reports would be captured by\begin{eqnarray}    N_{t+1}[\pi_{t+1,t+13}] & = & S_{t}[\pi_{t,t+12}]\\  N_{t+2}[\pi_{t+2,t+14}] & = & S_{t}[\pi_{t,t+12}]\\  N_{t+3}[\pi_{t+3,t+15}] & = & S_{t}[\pi_{t,t+12}]\end{eqnarray}where the timing is dictated by the fact that the SPF data are not published until near end of the month so that it only becomes possible for them to be published in news reports beginning in the next month.  The second and third equations indicate same SPF forecast continues to be published until a new forecast is available.To discuss this question clearly we need to introduce a notational convention about the monthly value to be assumed for the SPF forecast in months for which no SPF forecast is collected.

The first is that real journalists like to quote individual forecasters rather than reprint results of a publicly available survey; it seems plausible, therefore, that the news reports about inflation that are printed between the middle and the end of a month in which the survey is taken will on average reflect the forecasts made by the survey participants in that month, because the journalists are probably contacting roughly the same people as were contacted by the SPF. Since most inflation articles are published shortly after release of the month's inflation data and the articles often reflect interviews asking forecasters how the latest data affect their inflation outlook, it seems likely that most of the inflation articles published in a survey month will actually incorporate the information that is subsequently published in the SPF. This would imply that if month $t$ is a survey month,\begin{eqnarray}    N_{t}[\pi_{t,t+12}] & = & S_{t}[\pi_{t,t+12}]\\  N_{t+1}[\pi_{t+1,t+13}] & = & S_{t}[\pi_{t,t+12}]\\  N_{t+2}[\pi_{t+2,t+14}] & = & S_{t}[\pi_{t,t+12}]\end{eqnarray}The assumption that news reports keep repeating the last SPF forecast until a new one is collected is also questionable.  If forecasters update their forecasts more frequently than the SPF data are collected, newspaper reports on inflation are likely to reflect this new information in the period before the next SPF forecast is conducted.  However, in the absence of survey data in the intervening months, little can be done about this problem except to note that it may introduce some specification error that makes fit of the equation deteriorate.Furthermore, while there is typically only a single rational expectations solution to a macro model, dropping any element of the rational expectations framework often leads to a model with many possible equilibria which are difficult to choose among.Furthermore, it seems likely that a rigorous model of calculation-cost-minimization would lead to a periodic (`time dependent') solution rather than probabilistic updating.If month $t$ happened to be a month in which a SPF survey was conducted, it seems likely that No similar equation would apply for month $t+2$ or $t+3$ because theSPF forecast is collected only every third month.  Even if peopleConsider first the SPF forecasts.  On the other hand, mAssuming that the professional forecasters whom the journalists interview for their stories are able to process the new inflation data quickly, it seems likely that the news stories on inflation in mid-month will reflect mostly the same forecasts that are later reported in the SPF.However, by the time month $t+2$ ends the SPF forecast is more than two and a half months out of date.  There will have been two new statistical reports about both inflation and unemployment, income, retail sales, and capacity utilization that have arrived.  Assuming that news reports through the end of month $t+2$ continue to reflect the same forecast that was collected in the middle of month $t$ seems inappropriate.  The situation is even worse for the first half of month $t+3$, because there will have been three reports on unemployment, income, and retail sales since the last SPF forecasts were collected.  The safest course would seem to be to estimate\eqref{eq:monthlym3} only on data from months that were the finalmonth in a quarter, where the model can most realistically be saidto apply.One way to investigate this is through a simulation analysis in which the process for $N_{t}$ is taken to be the actual time path of SPF forecasts, and we assume that $\lambda_{1}= 0.15$ while $\lambda_{2} = 0.35$, yielding an {\it average} infection rate of 0.25.  Results of estimating~\eqref{eq:base} on this population are presented in Table~\ref{table:estonsim}.  Fortunately, the point estimate is quite close to 0.25, which suggests that when there is heterogeneity in $\lambda$, estimation of our baseline model will return a $\lambda$ that is close to the mean $\lambda$ in the population.The final row of the table presents results from an intermediate case where the $\lambda$'s are heterogeneous within a restricted range from $\lambda = 0.2$ to $\lambda = 0.3$.  Again the estimate of $\lambda$ is very close to its population mean, but the Durbin-Watson statistic indicates that correlation consequences of $\lambda$ heterogeneity are much more modest.Inflation expectations were chosen as the primary modeling target for two reasons.  First, standard theories of inflation imply that workers' inflation expectations can importantly influence inflation outcomes: Workers who expect higher inflation should push for greater wage increases, pushing up employers' costs and therefore prices.  Second, inflation expectations are one of the few macroeconomic variables for which a long time series exists on the expectations of the typical household.  The expectations data come from the University of Michigan's monthly Survey of Consumers, which is also the source for the closely-watched consumer sentiment index.  The baseline version of the model generates a simple analytical expression for the evolution of expectations that can be estimated using the published Michigan data.  The model turns out to do a remarkably good job in explaining these data, yielding an estimate that at any given time only about a quarter of households have fully up-to-date inflation expectations.If not, the most fruitful direction to explore next would probably be whether the literature on `small world' social networks could be applied to the problem.  (The small world literature examines the patterns of connection and transmission of information among members of social networks that exhibit both local (neighborhood) and global connections.  See Watts~\cite{watts:smallworld} for an excellent overview.)The primary conclusion is that the baseline equation for the model without social communication does a very good job in capturing the aggregate dynamics of inflation expectations even when social communication exists.  However, the estimate of the speed-of-transmission parameter $\lambda$ is biased upward, because news now spreads faster through the population than in the baseline model.This paper was written to provide an example of how the tools andtechniques of agent-based modeling developed in part at the Santa FeInstitute could be useful to macroeconomists.  The model of inflation expectations developed in this paper isa specific example of a more general modeling idea, which is that understanding macroeconomic dynamics requires a % Many problems in macro may be explained by learningThis paper has three main points.  If macroeconomists really believe that agents' expectations affectmacroeconomic outcomes, formulating and testing alternativetheoretical models of expectations should be a central part ofmacroeconomics.  Yet macroeconomists have largely `tested' modelsof expectations by comparing the macroeconomic dynamics they imply,rather than comparing them For reasons that are rather unclear but probably dateback to theprobably date back to debates in the 1950s, macroeconomistshave been relformulating and testing theoreticalmodels of expectations using empirical data on expectations should bea central part of macroeconomics.and if the empirical data rejectrational expectations, then the examination of empirical dataon expectations should be a central part of macroeconomics.  Whilethere have been a few important prior contributions (particularly byRoberts~\cite{roberts:inflexp} and Branch~\cite{branch:hetero}), thebulk of the macroeconomics profession has ignored the rich empiricaldata available on actual household and business expectations in favorof the theoretical purity of rational expectations models.The second point is that epidemiological models and agent-basedmodeling techniques provide a valuable set of approaches that can bedirectly applied to explain expectations data.  This paper and thecompanion paper Carroll~\cite{carroll:epidemicinflQJE} have shown thatfor inflation expectations and unemployment expectations, a simpleepidemiological model does a reasonably good job in explaining thedeviations of mean household expectations from the forecasts ofprofessionals.  And more complex epidemiological models, especiallyones with neighborhood effects and heterogeneity, can fit the dataeven better.The final point is that if we want to have macroeconomic models thatare built on really secure microfoundations, and are therefore asimmune as can reasonably be hoped from the Lucas critique, there is nosubstitute for building the model from the ground up, and comparingits predictions to whatever microeconomic data are available.  Whetherthe enterprise is described as a search for the `microfoundations' ofmacroeconomics or as `agent-based' modeling, the logic of the Lucascritique suggests that in the long run no macro model should becounted on as a reliable guide to macro behavior if its predictionsfor the expectations of individual actors bear little empiricalresemblance to the observable expectations of actual individuals.
