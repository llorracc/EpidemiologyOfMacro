Intro	Keynes idea that outcomes depend on expectations		Modern models based on RE				agents 						- know 'true' structure of economy			- have instant access to identical information sets			- obsessively pay attention to macroeconomic news				=> identical expectations				Xenophanes		Truth			conflicting forecasts				many people not well educated				costly to obtain and process and understand implications of info			Appeal of RE model: tractable and complete			This paper proposes a specific, simple, tractable deviation from RE framework			Instead of everybody being macroeconomists, people get their		views from news media				Not everybody reads every macroeconomic report			some people's views may be a bit out of date			The Model	- The Epidemiology of inflation expectations			Define M, N, pi				M_t = \lambda N_t + \lambda (1-\lambda) N_{t-1} + ...				Same as Mankiw-Reis, but more specific				Quarterly version?					People believe infl has a 'fundamental' value that follows 			random walk					Actual is F + e, e transitory						Test: ADF doesn't reject (table:ADFpi)						Newspapers contain forecast for next year				=> forecast for the fundamental rate							substitute formula for fundamental rate to obtain 							M_t	= \lambda N_t + (1-\lambda) M_{t-1}Estimation	Do the forecasts forecast?			Literature:					70s to mid-80s: forecasts are biased						various data, econometric, and conceptual problems				Croushore:					No bias over whole sample period						SPF better than Michigan mean					Results:					#MeanSquareErr					Results:  table:piforc					Both surveys have predictive power beyond the info contained in lagged infl								Both have power for predicing change in infl						Michigan is not significant in horserace regressions					Table:granger											Estimating the Stickiness of Inflation Expectations			table:esteqn			Baseline model: a1 and a2			Testing a1+a2=1					Modifications:			Allowing a0						Allowing lagged inflation					Conclusion: Baseline version works pretty well			Timing issues:		- SPF must have been released before HH's can adapt to it?			Not necessarily; newspaper forecasts probably include same info 			2 weeks earlier				- If M_{t+1} reflected first day of the month, 			M_{t+1} = \lambda S_t + (1-\lambda) M_{t}				would make perfect sense				- However, M_{t+1} is collected over entire month				- Conclusion: Get basically similar results on monthly data		Matching the Cross-Houshold Distribution of Inflation Expectations			Figure showing std facts from Curtin				Argue: periods with a lot of recent change in pi should have big stddev				Show std from homog and from heterog lambda models					Not nearly big enough				Can match std facts with sum of additive and multiplicative err term			Where does this come from?  So what?Testing Robustness	Heterogeneity in \lambda			Theory for 2-lambda version				uniform distribution of lambda [0.0,0.5] simulation results					Simulate model using history of inflation rates before 1981q3, SPF after						Estimate model on simulated data						Calculate std dev of infl expectations						table:heterolam		Social transmission			With both common-source and person-to-person infection					Key question is whether a positive constant term shows up in regressions
